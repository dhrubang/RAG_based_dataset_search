The first step in this journey was gathering some data to train a model. I plan to use deep learning to predict the wine variety using words in the description/review. The model still won't be able to taste the wine  but theoretically it could identify the wine based on a description that a sommelier could give. If anyone has any ideas on how to accomplish this  please post them! This dataset contains three files: winemag-data-130k-v2.csvcontains 10 columns and 130k rows of wine reviews. winemag-data_first150k.csvcontains 10 columns and 150k rows of wine reviews. winemag-data-130k-v2.jsoncontains 6919 nodes of wine reviews. Click on the data tab to see individual file descriptions  column-level metadata and summary statistics. The data was scraped fromWineEnthusiastduring the week of June 15th  2017. The code for the scraper can be foundhereif you have any more specific questions about data collection that I didn't address. UPDATE 11/24/2017After feedback from users of the dataset I scraped the reviews again on November 22nd  2017. This time around I collected the title of each review  which you can parse the year out of  the tasters name  and the taster's Twitter handle. This should also fix the duplicate entry issue. I think that this dataset offers some great opportunities for sentiment analysis and other text related predictive models. My overall goal is to create a model that can identify the variety  winery  and location of a wine based on a description. If anyone has any ideas  breakthroughs  or other interesting insights/models please post them.

I will also upload more games in the future as I collect them. This set contains the: For each of these separate games from Lichess. I collected this data using theLichess API  which enables collection of any given users game history. The difficult part was collecting usernames to use  however the API also enables dumping of all users in a Lichess team. There are several teams on Lichess with over 1 500 players  so this proved an effective way to get users to collect games from. Possible Uses Lots of information is contained within a single chess game  let alone a full dataset of multiple games. It is primarily a game of patterns  and data science is all about detecting patterns in data  which is why chess has been one of the most invested in areas of AI in the past. This dataset collects all of the information available from 20 000 games and presents it in a format that is easy to process for analysis of  for example  what allows a player to win as black or white  how much meta (out-of-game) factors affect a game  the relationship between openings and victory for black and white and more.

It is the third update of a publication originally generated to support the national Fire Program Analysis (FPA) system. The wildfire records were acquired from the reporting systems of federal  state  and local fire organizations. The following core data elements were required for records to be included in this data publication: discovery date  final fire size  and a point location at least as precise as Public Land Survey System (PLSS) section (1-square mile grid). The data were transformed to conform  when possible  to the data standards of the National Wildfire Coordinating Group (NWCG). Basic error-checking was performed and redundant records were identified and removed  to the degree possible. The resulting product  referred to as the Fire Program Analysis fire-occurrence database (FPA FOD)  includes 1.88 million geo-referenced wildfire records  representing a total of 140 million acres burned during the 24-year period.

Link:US Public Food Assistance 2 - SNAPPlease click on the ‚ñ≤ if you find it useful -- it has almost 500 downloads! This dataset  Part 1  addresses another US program  the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women  Infants  and Children Program  or simply WIC. The program allocates Federal and State funds to help low-income women and children up to age five who are at nutritional risk. Funds are used to provide supplemental foods  baby formula  health care  and nutrition education. Files may include participation data and spending for state programs  and poverty data for each state.  Data for WIC  covers fiscal years 2013-2016  which is actually October 2012 through September 2016. My original purpose here is two-fold: Explore various  aspects of US Public Assistance. Show trends over recent years and better understand differences across state agencies.  Although the federal government sponsors the program and provides funding  program are administered at the state level and can widely vary. Indian nations (native Americans) also administer their own programs. Share with the Kaggle Community the joy - and pain -  of working with government data. Data is often spread across numerous agency sites and comes in a variety of formats. Often the data is provided in Excel  with the files consisting of multiple tabs. Also  files are formatted as reports and contain aggregated data (sums  averages  etc.) along with base data. As of March 2nd  I am expanding the purpose to support theM5 Forecasting Challengeshere on Kaggle. Store sales are partly driven by participation in Public Assistance programs. Participants typically receive the items free of charge. The store then recovers the sale price from the state agencies administering the program.

It's a large fruit  and is the most common commercial variety globally. A synthetic dataset simulating measurements designed for a classification task in predicting avocado ripeness stages using physical characteristics. In avocado ripening  weight and size have indirect but measurable relationships with ripeness  primarily through moisture content and cellular structure changes. Here's how I would structure their relationship in the synthetic dataset: 1. Weight PatternsAs avocados ripen  they lose moisture through respiration and cell wall degradation  reducing weight while maintaining similar size. 2. Size PatternsRipening causes cell separation and gas accumulation (ethylene production)  slightly increasing apparent size despite weight loss. 3. Key Relationship: DensityThis density gradient becomes a hidden predictor even if not explicitly included in the dataset. Density (g/cm¬≥) = Weight / Size

The dataset contains transactions made by credit cards in September 2013 by European cardholders.This dataset presents transactions that occurred in two days  where we have 492 frauds out of 284 807 transactions. The dataset is highly unbalanced  the positive class (frauds) account for 0.172% of all transactions. It contains only numerical input variables which are the result of a PCA transformation. Unfortunately  due to confidentiality issues  we cannot provide the original features and more background information about the data. Features V1  V2  ‚Ä¶ V28 are the principal components obtained with PCA  the only features which have not been transformed with PCA are 'Time' and 'Amount'. Feature 'Time' contains the seconds elapsed between each transaction and the first transaction in the dataset. The feature 'Amount' is the transaction Amount  this feature can be used for example-dependant cost-sensitive learning. Feature 'Class' is the response variable and it takes value 1 in case of fraud and 0 otherwise. Given the class imbalance ratio  we recommend measuring the accuracy using the Area Under the Precision-Recall Curve (AUPRC). Confusion matrix accuracy is not meaningful for unbalanced classification. A simulator for transaction data has been released as part of the practical handbook on Machine Learning for Credit Card Fraud Detection -https://fraud-detection-handbook.github.io/fraud-detection-handbook/Chapter_3_GettingStarted/SimulatedDataset.html. We invite all practitioners interested in fraud detection datasets to also check out this data simulator  and the methodologies for credit card fraud detection presented in the book.

Metadata Collaborators Authors Coverage DOI Citation Provenance License Expected Update Frequency Activity Overview Views Downloads Engagement Comments Top Contributors Detail View Related Notebooks Similar Datasets,"Description: The ""Daily Social Media Active Users"" dataset provides a comprehensive and dynamic look into the digital presence and activity of global users across major social media platforms. The data was generated to simulate real-world usage patterns for 13 popular platforms  including Facebook  YouTube  WhatsApp  Instagram  WeChat  TikTok  Telegram  Snapchat  X (formerly Twitter)  Pinterest  Reddit  Threads  LinkedIn  and Quora. This dataset contains 10 000 rows and includes several key fields that offer insights into user demographics  engagement  and usage habits. Dataset Breakdown: Platform: The name of the social media platform where the user activity is tracked. It includes globally recognized platforms  such as Facebook  YouTube  and TikTok  that are known for their large  active user bases. Owner: The company or entity that owns and operates the platform. Examples include Meta for Facebook  Instagram  and WhatsApp  Google for YouTube  and ByteDance for TikTok. Primary Usage: This category identifies the primary function of each platform. Social media platforms differ in their primary usage  whether it's for social networking  messaging  multimedia sharing  professional networking  or more. Country: The geographical region where the user is located. The dataset simulates global coverage  showcasing users from diverse locations and regions. It helps in understanding how user behavior varies across different countries. Daily Time Spent (min): This field tracks how much time a user spends on a given platform on a daily basis  expressed in minutes. Time spent data is critical for understanding user engagement levels and the popularity of specific platforms. Verified Account: Indicates whether the user has a verified account. This feature mimics real-world patterns where verified users (often public figures  businesses  or influencers) have enhanced status on social media platforms. Date Joined: The date when the user registered or started using the platform. This data simulates user account history and can provide insights into user retention trends or platform growth over time. Context and Use Cases: Researchers  data scientists  and developers can use this dataset to: Model User Behavior: By analyzing patterns in daily time spent  verified status  and country of origin  users can model and predict social media engagement behavior. Test Analytics Tools: Social media monitoring and analytics platforms can use this dataset to simulate user activity and optimize their tools for engagement tracking  reporting  and visualization. Train Machine Learning Algorithms: The dataset can be used to train models for various tasks like user segmentation  recommendation systems  or churn prediction based on engagement metrics. Create Dashboards: This dataset can serve as the foundation for creating user-friendly dashboards that visualize user trends  platform comparisons  and engagement patterns across the globe. Conduct Market Research: Business intelligence teams can use the data to understand how various demographics use social media  offering valuable insights into the most engaged regions  platform preferences  and usage behaviors. Sources of Inspiration:This dataset is inspired by public data from industry reports  such as those from Statista  DataReportal  and other market research platforms. These sources provide insights into the global user base and usage statistics of popular social media platforms. The synthetic nature of this dataset allows for the use of realistic engagement metrics without violating any privacy concerns  making it an ideal tool for educational  analytical  and research purposes. The structure and design of the dataset are based on real-world usage patterns and aim to represent a variety of users from different backgrounds  countries  and activity levels. This diversity makes it an ideal candidate for testing data-driven solutions and exploring social media trends. Future Considerations: As the social media landscape continues to evolve  this dataset can be updated or extended to include new platforms  engagement metrics  or user behaviors. Future iterations may incorporate features like post frequency  follower counts  engagement rates (likes  comments  shares)  or even sentiment analysis from user-generated content. By leveraging this dataset  analysts and data scientists can create better  more effective strategies for digital marketing  engagement  and user retention across different social media platforms. Ethical Considerations: Since this dataset is synthetic  it does not include any real user data or personally identifiable information (PII). It follows best practices for data privacy and protection. It is important to note that while the data mimics real-world patterns  it is not a direct reflection of actual user behavior  and care should be taken when drawing conclusions based on its analysis."

On April 15  1912  during her maiden voyage  the widely considered ‚Äúunsinkable‚Äù RMS Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg. Unfortunately  there weren‚Äôt enough lifeboats for everyone on board  resulting in the death of 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew. While there was some element of luck involved in surviving  it seems some groups of people were more likely to survive than others. In this challenge  we ask you to build a predictive model that answers the question: ‚Äúwhat sorts of people were more likely to survive?‚Äù using passenger data (ie name  age  gender  socio-economic class  etc).

Metadata Collaborators Authors Coverage DOI Citation Provenance License Expected Update Frequency Activity Overview Views Downloads Engagement Comments Top Contributors Detail View Related Notebooks Similar Datasets,Dataset SummaryEarly beta release of pre-parsed English and French Wikipedia articles including infoboxes. Inviting feedback. This dataset contains all articles of theEnglishandFrenchlanguage editions of Wikipedia  pre-parsed and outputted as structured JSON files with a consistent schema. Each JSON line holds the content of one full Wikipedia article stripped of extra markdown and non-prose sections (references  etc.). Invitation for FeedbackThe dataset is built as part of the Structured Contents initiative and based on the Wikimedia Enterprise htmlsnapshots.  It is an early beta release to improve transparency in the development process and request feedback. This first version includes pre-parsed Wikipedia abstracts  short descriptions  main images links  infoboxes and article sections  excluding non-prose sections (e.g. references). More elements (such as lists and tables) may be added over time. For updates follow the project‚Äôsblogand our Mediawiki Quarterly softwareupdateson MediaWiki.As this is an early beta release  we highly value your feedback to help us refine and improve this dataset. Please share your thoughts  suggestions  and any issues you encounter either on thediscussion pageof Wikimedia Enterprise‚Äôs homepage on Meta wiki  or on the discussion page for this dataset here on Kaggle. The contents of this dataset of Wikipedia articles is collectively written and curated by a global volunteer community. All original textual content is licensed under theGNU Free Documentation License(GFDL) and theCreative Commons Attribution-Share-Alike 4.0 License. Some text may be available only under the Creative Commons license; see theWikimedia Terms of Usefor details. Text written by some authors may be released under additional licenses or into the public domain. The dataset in its structured form is generally helpful for a wide variety of tasks  including all phases of model development  from pre-training to alignment  fine-tuning  updating/RAG as well as testing/benchmarking.We would love to hear more about your use cases. Data FieldsThe data fields are the same among all  noteworthy included fields:name- title of the article.identifier- ID of the article.url- URL of the article.version: metadata related to the latest specific revision of the articleversion.editor- editor-specific signals that can help contextualize the revisionversion.scores- returns assessments by ML models on the likelihood of a revision being reverted.main entity- Wikidata QID the article is related to.abstract- lead section  summarizing what the article is about.description-  one-sentence description of the article for quick reference.image- main image representing the article's subject.infoboxes- parsed information from the side panel (infobox) on the Wikipedia article.sections-  parsed sections of the article  including links.Note: excludes other media/images  lists  tables and references or similar non-prose sections.Full data dictionary is available here:https://enterprise.wikimedia.com/docs/data-dictionary/ Curation RationaleThis dataset has been created as part of the largerStructured Contents initiative at Wikimedia Enterprisewith the aim of making Wikimedia data more machine readable. These efforts are both focused on pre-parsing Wikipedia snippets as well as connecting the different projects closer together.Even if Wikipedia is very structured to the human eye  it is a non-trivial task to extract the knowledge lying within in a machine readable manner. Projects  languages  domains all have their own specific community experts and way of structuring data  bolstered by various templates and best practices. A specific example we‚Äôve addressed in this release is article infoboxes. Infoboxes are panels that commonly appear in the top right corner of a Wikipedia article and summarize key facts and statistics of the article‚Äôs subject. The editorial community works hard to keep infoboxes populated with the article‚Äôs most pertinent and current metadata  and we‚Äôd like to lower the barrier of entry significantly so that this data is also accessible at scale without the need for bespoke parsing systems. We also include the link to theWikidata QIdentifier (corresponding Wikidata entity)  and the link to (main and infobox) images to facilitate easier access to additional information on the specific topics. You will also findCredibility Signals fieldsincluded. These can help you decide when  how  and why to use what is in the dataset. These fields mirror the over 20 years of editorial policies created and kept by the Wikipedia editing communities  taking publicly available information and structuring it. Like with article structures  because this information is not centralized (neither on a single project nor across them)  it is hard to access. Credibility signals shine a light on that blind spot. You will find most of these signals under the ‚Äòversion‚Äô object  but other objects like ‚Äòprotection‚Äô and ‚Äòwatchers_count‚Äô offer similar insight. This is an early beta release of pre-parsed Wikipedia articles in bulk  as a means to improve transparency in the development process and gather insights of current use cases to follow where the AI community needs us most; as well as feedback points  to develop this further through collaboration. There will be limitations (see ‚Äòknown limitations‚Äô section below)  but in line withour values  we believe it is better to share early  often  and respond to feedback. You can also test out more languages on an article by article basis through ourbeta Structured Contents On-demand endpointwith afree account.

Metadata Collaborators Authors Coverage DOI Citation Provenance License Expected Update Frequency Activity Overview Views Downloads Engagement Comments Top Contributors Detail View Related Notebooks Similar Datasets,A brain tumor is a collection  or mass  of abnormal cells in your brain. Your skull  which encloses your brain  is very rigid. Any growth inside such a restricted space can cause problems. Brain tumors can be cancerous (malignant) or noncancerous (benign). When benign or malignant tumors grow  they can cause the pressure inside your skull to increase. This can cause brain damage  and it can be life-threatening. Early detection and classification of brain tumors is an important research domain in the field of medical imaging and accordingly helps in selecting the most convenient treatment method to save patients life therefore The application of deep learning approaches in context to improve health diagnosis is providing impactful solutions. According to the World Health Organization (WHO)  proper brain tumor diagnosis involves detection  brain tumor location identification  and classification of the tumor on the basis of malignancy  grade  and type. This experimental work in the diagnosis of brain tumors using Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) involves detecting the tumor  classifying the tumor in terms of grade  type  and identification of tumor location. This method has experimented in terms of utilizing one model for classifying brain MRI on different classification tasks rather than an individual model for each classification task. The Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based multi-task classification is equipped for the classification and detection of tumors. The identification of brain tumor location is also done using a CNN-based model by segmenting the brain tumor. This dataset is a combination of the following three datasets :figshareSARTAJ datasetBr35H This dataset contains7023images of human brain MRI images which are classified into 4 classes:glioma-meningioma-no tumorandpituitary. no tumor class images were taken from the Br35H dataset. I think SARTAJ dataset has a problem that the glioma class images are not categorized correctly  I realized this from the results of other people's work as well as the different models I trained  which is why I deleted the images in this folder and used the images on the figshare site instead. Pay attention that The size of the images in this dataset is different. You can resize the image to the desired size after pre-processing and removing the extra margins. This work will improve the accuracy of the modelpre-processing code If you find this dataset helpful  feel free to upvote it!And do give me your suggestions or opinions. Thank you  üòâ

They are one of the most common phytoplankton species found in nature. There are more than 200 genera of diatoms  as well as about 200 000 species. They produce approximately 20-25% of the oxygen on the planet. Accurate detection  segmentation and classification of diatoms is very important  especially in terms of determining water quality and ecological change.Colorized Data Processing Techniques for Medical Imaging Medical images like CT scans and X-rays are typically grayscale  making subtle anatomical or pathological differences harder to distinguish. The following image processing and enhancement techniques are used to colorize and improve visual interpretation for diagnostics  training  or AI preprocessing. üî∑ 1. 3D_RenderingRenders medical image volumes into three-dimensional visualizations. Though often grayscale  color can be applied to different tissue types or densities to enhance spatial understanding. Useful in surgical planning or tumor visualization. üî∑ 2. 3D_Volume_RenderingAn advanced visualization technique that projects 3D image volumes with transparency and color blending  simulating how light passes through tissue. Color helps distinguish internal structures like organs  vessels  or tumors. üî∑ 3. Adaptive Histogram Equalization (AHE)Enhances contrast locally within the image  especially in low-contrast regions. When colorized  different intensities are mapped to distinct hues  improving visibility of fine-grained details like soft tissues or lesions. üî∑ 4. Alpha BlendingA layering technique that combines multiple images (e.g.  CT + annotation masks) with transparency. Colors represent different modalities or regions of interest  providing composite visual cues for diagnosis. üî∑ 5. Basic Color MapApplies a standard color palette (like Jet or Viridis) to grayscale data. Different intensities are mapped to different colors  enhancing the visual discrimination of anatomical or pathological regions in the image. üî∑ 6. Contrast StretchingExpands the grayscale range to improve brightness and contrast. When combined with color mapping  tissues with similar intensities become visually distinct  aiding in tasks like bone vs. soft tissue separation. üî∑ 7. Edge DetectionExtracts and overlays object boundaries (e.g.  organ or lesion outlines) on the original scan. Edge maps are typically colorized (e.g.  green or red) to highlight anatomical structures or abnormalities clearly. üî∑ 8. Gamma CorrectionAdjusts image brightness non-linearly. Color can be used to highlight underexposed or overexposed regions  often revealing soft tissue structures otherwise hidden in raw grayscale CT/X-ray images. üî∑ 9. Gaussian BlurSmooths image noise and details. When visualized with color overlays (e.g.  before vs. after)  it helps assess denoising effectiveness. It is also used in segmentation preprocessing to reduce edge artifacts. üî∑ 10. Heatmap VisualizationEncodes intensity or prediction confidence into a heatmap overlay (e.g.  red for high activity). Common in AI-assisted diagnosis to localize tumors  fractures  or infections  layered over the original grayscale image. üî∑ 11. Interactive SegmentationA semi-automated method to extract regions of interest with user input. Segmented areas are color-coded (e.g.  tumor = red  background = blue) for immediate visual confirmation and further analysis. üî∑ 12. LUT (Lookup Table) Color MapMaps grayscale values to custom color palettes using a lookup table. This enhances contrast and emphasizes certain intensity ranges (e.g.  blood vessels vs. bone)  improving interpretability for radiologists. üî∑ 13. Random Color PaletteApplies random but consistent colors to segmented regions or labels. Common in datasets with multiple classes (e.g.  liver  spleen  kidneys)  it helps in visual verification of label diversity. üß¨ ConclusionThese colorization methods do not change the underlying medical data  but they significantly enhance its interpretability for radiologists  researchers  and machine learning algorithms. Color adds clarity  contrast  and context to features that may be missed in grayscale  making it a powerful tool in modern medical imaging workflows. #Raw Data  Source  More Information ::https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/huseyingunduz/diatom-dataset?select=imagesCitation@article{gunduz2022  title={Segmentation of diatoms using edge detection and deep learning}  volume={30}  DOI={10.55730/1300-0632.3938}  number={6}  journal={Turkish Journal of Electrical Engineering & Computer Sciences}  author={Gunduz  Huseyin and Solak  Cuneyt Nadir and Gunal  Serkan}  year={2022}  pages={ 2268‚Äì2285}} RRA_Think Differently  Create history‚Äôs next line.

The following image processing and enhancement techniques are used to colorize and improve visual interpretation for diagnostics  training  or AI preprocessing. üî∑ 1. 3D_RenderingRenders medical image volumes into three-dimensional visualizations. Though often grayscale  color can be applied to different tissue types or densities to enhance spatial understanding. Useful in surgical planning or tumor visualization. üî∑ 2. 3D_Volume_RenderingAn advanced visualization technique that projects 3D image volumes with transparency and color blending  simulating how light passes through tissue. Color helps distinguish internal structures like organs  vessels  or tumors. üî∑ 3. Adaptive Histogram Equalization (AHE)Enhances contrast locally within the image  especially in low-contrast regions. When colorized  different intensities are mapped to distinct hues  improving visibility of fine-grained details like soft tissues or lesions. üî∑ 4. Alpha BlendingA layering technique that combines multiple images (e.g.  CT + annotation masks) with transparency. Colors represent different modalities or regions of interest  providing composite visual cues for diagnosis. üî∑ 5. Basic Color MapApplies a standard color palette (like Jet or Viridis) to grayscale data. Different intensities are mapped to different colors  enhancing the visual discrimination of anatomical or pathological regions in the image. üî∑ 6. Contrast StretchingExpands the grayscale range to improve brightness and contrast. When combined with color mapping  tissues with similar intensities become visually distinct  aiding in tasks like bone vs. soft tissue separation. üî∑ 7. Edge DetectionExtracts and overlays object boundaries (e.g.  organ or lesion outlines) on the original scan. Edge maps are typically colorized (e.g.  green or red) to highlight anatomical structures or abnormalities clearly. üî∑ 8. Gamma CorrectionAdjusts image brightness non-linearly. Color can be used to highlight underexposed or overexposed regions  often revealing soft tissue structures otherwise hidden in raw grayscale CT/X-ray images. üî∑ 9. Gaussian BlurSmooths image noise and details. When visualized with color overlays (e.g.  before vs. after)  it helps assess denoising effectiveness. It is also used in segmentation preprocessing to reduce edge artifacts. üî∑ 10. Heatmap VisualizationEncodes intensity or prediction confidence into a heatmap overlay (e.g.  red for high activity). Common in AI-assisted diagnosis to localize tumors  fractures  or infections  layered over the original grayscale image. üî∑ 11. Interactive SegmentationA semi-automated method to extract regions of interest with user input. Segmented areas are color-coded (e.g.  tumor = red  background = blue) for immediate visual confirmation and further analysis. üî∑ 12. LUT (Lookup Table) Color MapMaps grayscale values to custom color palettes using a lookup table. This enhances contrast and emphasizes certain intensity ranges (e.g.  blood vessels vs. bone)  improving interpretability for radiologists. üî∑ 13. Random Color PaletteApplies random but consistent colors to segmented regions or labels. Common in datasets with multiple classes (e.g.  liver  spleen  kidneys)  it helps in visual verification of label diversity. üß¨ ConclusionThese colorization methods do not change the underlying medical data  but they significantly enhance its interpretability for radiologists  researchers  and machine learning algorithms. Color adds clarity  contrast  and context to features that may be missed in grayscale  making it a powerful tool in modern medical imaging workflows. https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/donajui/bone-marrow-cell-classification This dataset contains 7 000 labeled images of white blood cells  divided into 7 distinct classes based on cell type.

Metadata Collaborators Authors Coverage DOI Citation Provenance License Expected Update Frequency Activity Overview Views Downloads Engagement Comments Top Contributors Detail View Related Notebooks Similar Datasets,What can we say about the success of a movie before it is released? Are there certain companies (Pixar?) that have found a consistent formula? Given that major films costing over $100 million to produce can still flop  this question is more important than ever to the industry. Film aficionados might have different interests. Can we predict which films will be highly rated  whether or not they are a commercial success? This is a great place to start digging in to those questions  with data on the plot  cast  crew  budget  and revenues of several thousand films. We (Kaggle) have removed the original version of this dataset per aDMCAtakedown request from IMDB. In order to minimize the impact  we're replacing it with a similar set of films and data fields fromThe Movie Database (TMDb)in accordance withtheir terms of use. The bad news is that kernels built on the old dataset will most likely no longer work. The good news is that: You can port your existing kernels over with a bit of editing.This kerneloffers functions and examples for doing so. You can also finda general introduction to the new format here. The new dataset contains full credits for both the cast and the crew  rather than just the first three actors. Actor and actresses are now listed in the order they appear in the credits. It's unclear what ordering the original dataset used; for the movies I spot checked it didn't line up with either the credits order or IMDB's stars order. The revenues appear to be more current. For example  IMDB's figures for Avatar seem to be from 2010 and understate the film's global revenues by over $2 billion. Some of the movies that we weren't able to port over (a couple of hundred) were just bad entries. For example this IMDB entryhas basically no accurate information at all. It lists Star Wars Episode VII as a documentary. Several of the new columns contain json. You can save a bit of time by porting the load data functions [from this kernel](). Even in simple fields like runtime may not be consistent across versions. For example  previous dataset shows the duration for Avatar's extended cut while TMDB shows the time for the original version. There's now a separate file containing the full credits for both the cast and crew. All fields are filled out by users so don't expect them to agree on keywords  genres  ratings  or the like. Your existing kernels will continue to render normally until they are re-run. If you are curious about how this dataset was prepared  the code to access TMDb's API is postedhere. New columns: homepage id original_title overview popularity production_companies production_countries release_date spoken_languages status tagline vote_average Lost columns: actor_1_facebook_likes actor_2_facebook_likes actor_3_facebook_likes aspect_ratio cast_total_facebook_likes color content_rating director_facebook_likes facenumber_in_poster movie_facebook_likes movie_imdb_link num_critic_for_reviews num_user_for_reviews There are some things we haven't had a chance to confirm about the new dataset. If you have any insights  please let us know in the forums! Are the budgets and revenues all in US dollars? Do they consistently show the global revenues? This dataset hasn't yet gone through a data quality analysis. Can you find any obvious corrections? For example  in the IMDb version it was necessary to treat values of zero in the budget field as missing. Similar findings would be very helpful to your fellow Kagglers! (It's probably a good idea to keep treating zeros as missing  with the caveat that missing budgets much more likely to have been from small budget films in the first place). Can you categorize the films by type  such as animated or not? We don't have explicit labels for this  but it should be possible to build them from the crew's job titles. How sharp is the divide between major film studios and the independents? Do those two groups fall naturally out of a clustering analysis or is something more complicated going on? This dataset was generated fromThe Movie DatabaseAPI. This product uses the TMDb API but is not endorsed or certified by TMDb.Their API also provides access to data on many additional movies  actors and actresses  crew members  and TV shows.

Its features allows viewing an order from multiple dimensions: from order status  price  payment and freight performance to customer location  product attributes and finally reviews written by customers. We also released a geolocation dataset that relates Brazilian zip codes to lat/lng coordinates. This is real commercial data  it has been anonymised  and references to the companies and partners in the review text have been replaced with the names of Game of Thrones great houses. We have also released aMarketing Funnel Dataset. You may join both datasets and see an order from Marketing perspective now! Instructions on joining are available on thisKernel. This dataset was generously provided by Olist  the largest department store in Brazilian marketplaces. Olist connects small businesses from all over Brazil to channels without hassle and with a single contract. Those merchants are able to sell their products through the Olist Store and ship them directly to the customers using Olist logistics partners. See more on our website:www.olist.com After a customer purchases the product from Olist Store a seller gets notified to fulfill that order. Once the customer receives the product  or the estimated delivery date is due  the customer gets a satisfaction survey by email where he can give a note for the purchase experience and write down some comments. The data is divided in multiple datasets for better understanding and organization. Please refer to the following data schema when working with it: We had previously released a classified dataset  but we removed it atVersion 6. We intend to release it again as a new dataset with a new data schema. While we don't finish it  you may use the classified dataset available at theVersion 5or previous. Here are some inspiration for possible outcomes from this dataset. NLP:This dataset offers a supreme environment to parse out the reviews text through its multiple dimensions. Clustering:Some customers didn't write a review. But why are they happy or mad? Sales Prediction:With purchase date information you'll be able to predict future sales. Delivery Performance:You will also be able to work through delivery performance and find ways to optimize delivery times. Product Quality:Enjoy yourself discovering the products categories that are more prone to customer insatisfaction.

Training of neural networks for automated diagnosis of pigmented skin lesions is hampered by the small size and lack of diversity of available dataset of dermatoscopic images. We tackle this problem by releasing the HAM10000 (""Human Against Machine with 10000 training images"") dataset. We collected dermatoscopic images from different populations  acquired and stored by different modalities. The final dataset consists of 10015 dermatoscopic images which can serve as a training set for academic machine learning purposes. Cases include a representative collection of all important diagnostic categories in the realm of pigmented lesions: Actinic keratoses and intraepithelial carcinoma / Bowen's disease (akiec)  basal cell carcinoma (bcc)  benign keratosis-like lesions (solar lentigines / seborrheic keratoses and lichen-planus like keratoses  bkl)  dermatofibroma (df)  melanoma (mel)  melanocytic nevi (nv) and vascular lesions (angiomas  angiokeratomas  pyogenic granulomas and hemorrhage  vasc). More than 50% of lesions are confirmed through histopathology (histo)  the ground truth for the rest of the cases is either follow-up examination (follow_up)  expert consensus (consensus)  or confirmation by in-vivo confocal microscopy (confocal). The dataset includes lesions with multiple images  which can be tracked by the lesion_id-column within the HAM10000_metadata file. The test set is not public  but the evaluation server remains running (see the challenge website). Any publications written using the HAM10000 data should be evaluated on the official test set hosted there  so that methods can be fairly compared."

Metadata Collaborators Authors Coverage DOI Citation Provenance License Expected Update Frequency Activity Overview Views Downloads Engagement Comments Top Contributors Detail View Related Notebooks,Relevant links: AbstractWe propose a new test to measure a text model's multitask accuracy. The test covers 57 tasks including elementary mathematics  US history  computer science  law  and more. To attain high accuracy on this test  models must possess extensive world knowledge and problem solving ability. We find that while most recent models have near random-chance accuracy  the very largest GPT-3 model improves over random chance by almost 20 percentage points on average. However  on every one of the 57 tasks  the best models still need substantial improvements before they can reach expert-level accuracy. Models also have lopsided performance and frequently do not know when they are wrong. Worse  they still have near-random accuracy on some socially important subjects such as morality and law. By comprehensively evaluating the breadth and depth of a model's academic and professional understanding  our test can be used to analyze models across many tasks and to identify important shortcomings.

They are one of the most common phytoplankton species found in nature. There are more than 200 genera of diatoms  as well as about 200 000 species. They produce approximately 20-25% of the oxygen on the planet. Accurate detection  segmentation and classification of diatoms is very important  especially in terms of determining water quality and ecological change.Colorized Data Processing Techniques for Medical Imaging Medical images like CT scans and X-rays are typically grayscale  making subtle anatomical or pathological differences harder to distinguish. The following image processing and enhancement techniques are used to colorize and improve visual interpretation for diagnostics  training  or AI preprocessing. üî∑ 1. 3D_RenderingRenders medical image volumes into three-dimensional visualizations. Though often grayscale  color can be applied to different tissue types or densities to enhance spatial understanding. Useful in surgical planning or tumor visualization. üî∑ 2. 3D_Volume_RenderingAn advanced visualization technique that projects 3D image volumes with transparency and color blending  simulating how light passes through tissue. Color helps distinguish internal structures like organs  vessels  or tumors. üî∑ 3. Adaptive Histogram Equalization (AHE)Enhances contrast locally within the image  especially in low-contrast regions. When colorized  different intensities are mapped to distinct hues  improving visibility of fine-grained details like soft tissues or lesions. üî∑ 4. Alpha BlendingA layering technique that combines multiple images (e.g.  CT + annotation masks) with transparency. Colors represent different modalities or regions of interest  providing composite visual cues for diagnosis. üî∑ 5. Basic Color MapApplies a standard color palette (like Jet or Viridis) to grayscale data. Different intensities are mapped to different colors  enhancing the visual discrimination of anatomical or pathological regions in the image. üî∑ 6. Contrast StretchingExpands the grayscale range to improve brightness and contrast. When combined with color mapping  tissues with similar intensities become visually distinct  aiding in tasks like bone vs. soft tissue separation. üî∑ 7. Edge DetectionExtracts and overlays object boundaries (e.g.  organ or lesion outlines) on the original scan. Edge maps are typically colorized (e.g.  green or red) to highlight anatomical structures or abnormalities clearly. üî∑ 8. Gamma CorrectionAdjusts image brightness non-linearly. Color can be used to highlight underexposed or overexposed regions  often revealing soft tissue structures otherwise hidden in raw grayscale CT/X-ray images. üî∑ 9. Gaussian BlurSmooths image noise and details. When visualized with color overlays (e.g.  before vs. after)  it helps assess denoising effectiveness. It is also used in segmentation preprocessing to reduce edge artifacts. üî∑ 10. Heatmap VisualizationEncodes intensity or prediction confidence into a heatmap overlay (e.g.  red for high activity). Common in AI-assisted diagnosis to localize tumors  fractures  or infections  layered over the original grayscale image. üî∑ 11. Interactive SegmentationA semi-automated method to extract regions of interest with user input. Segmented areas are color-coded (e.g.  tumor = red  background = blue) for immediate visual confirmation and further analysis. üî∑ 12. LUT (Lookup Table) Color MapMaps grayscale values to custom color palettes using a lookup table. This enhances contrast and emphasizes certain intensity ranges (e.g.  blood vessels vs. bone)  improving interpretability for radiologists. üî∑ 13. Random Color PaletteApplies random but consistent colors to segmented regions or labels. Common in datasets with multiple classes (e.g.  liver  spleen  kidneys)  it helps in visual verification of label diversity. üß¨ ConclusionThese colorization methods do not change the underlying medical data  but they significantly enhance its interpretability for radiologists  researchers  and machine learning algorithms.

Brain glioma refers to a type of tumor that originates in the glial cells of the brain  which provide support and protection to neurons. Gliomas are often aggressive and can occur in various parts of the brain  leading to symptoms like headaches  seizures  and cognitive impairments. Brain meningioma is a tumor that develops from the meninges  the layers of tissue covering the brain and spinal cord. Meningiomas are typically benign but can cause problems depending on their size and location  leading to symptoms such as vision problems  headaches  and neurological deficits. Lastly  the term brain tumor is a broad classification that includes various types of tumors that can develop in the brain  including both malignant and benign forms. Brain tumors can be primary (originating in the brain) or secondary (spreading from other parts of the body)  and they can result in diverse symptoms based on their type and location  such as motor dysfunction  memory issues  or seizures. Colorized Data Processing Techniques for Medical Imaging Medical images like CT scans and X-rays are typically grayscale  making subtle anatomical or pathological differences harder to distinguish. The following image processing and enhancement techniques are used to colorize and improve visual interpretation for diagnostics  training  or AI preprocessing. üî∑ 1. 3D_RenderingRenders medical image volumes into three-dimensional visualizations. Though often grayscale  color can be applied to different tissue types or densities to enhance spatial understanding. Useful in surgical planning or tumor visualization. üî∑ 2. 3D_Volume_RenderingAn advanced visualization technique that projects 3D image volumes with transparency and color blending  simulating how light passes through tissue. Color helps distinguish internal structures like organs  vessels  or tumors. üî∑ 3. Adaptive Histogram Equalization (AHE)Enhances contrast locally within the image  especially in low-contrast regions. When colorized  different intensities are mapped to distinct hues  improving visibility of fine-grained details like soft tissues or lesions. üî∑ 4. Alpha BlendingA layering technique that combines multiple images (e.g.  CT + annotation masks) with transparency. Colors represent different modalities or regions of interest  providing composite visual cues for diagnosis. üî∑ 5. Basic Color MapApplies a standard color palette (like Jet or Viridis) to grayscale data. Different intensities are mapped to different colors  enhancing the visual discrimination of anatomical or pathological regions in the image. üî∑ 6. Contrast StretchingExpands the grayscale range to improve brightness and contrast. When combined with color mapping  tissues with similar intensities become visually distinct  aiding in tasks like bone vs. soft tissue separation. üî∑ 7. Edge DetectionExtracts and overlays object boundaries (e.g.  organ or lesion outlines) on the original scan. Edge maps are typically colorized (e.g.  green or red) to highlight anatomical structures or abnormalities clearly. üî∑ 8. Gamma CorrectionAdjusts image brightness non-linearly. Color can be used to highlight underexposed or overexposed regions  often revealing soft tissue structures otherwise hidden in raw grayscale CT/X-ray images. üî∑ 9. Gaussian BlurSmooths image noise and details. When visualized with color overlays (e.g.  before vs. after)  it helps assess denoising effectiveness. It is also used in segmentation preprocessing to reduce edge artifacts. üî∑ 10. Heatmap VisualizationEncodes intensity or prediction confidence into a heatmap overlay (e.g.  red for high activity). Common in AI-assisted diagnosis to localize tumors  fractures  or infections  layered over the original grayscale image. üî∑ 11. Interactive SegmentationA semi-automated method to extract regions of interest with user input. Segmented areas are color-coded (e.g.  tumor = red  background = blue) for immediate visual confirmation and further analysis. üî∑ 12. LUT (Lookup Table) Color MapMaps grayscale values to custom color palettes using a lookup table. This enhances contrast and emphasizes certain intensity ranges (e.g.  blood vessels vs. bone)  improving interpretability for radiologists. üî∑ 13. Random Color PaletteApplies random but consistent colors to segmented regions or labels. Common in datasets with multiple classes (e.g.  liver  spleen  kidneys)  it helps in visual verification of label diversity. üß¨ ConclusionThese colorization methods do not change the underlying medical data  but they significantly enhance its interpretability for radiologists  researchers  and machine learning algorithms. Color adds clarity  contrast  and context to features that may be missed in grayscale  making it a powerful tool in modern medical imaging workflows. #Raw Data  Source  More Information ::Rahman  Md Mizanur (2024)  ‚ÄúBrain Cancer -  MRI dataset‚Äù  Mendeley Data  V1  doi: 10.17632/mk56jw9rns.1https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/mk56jw9rns/1 RRA_Think Differently  Create history‚Äôs next line.

The difference is that fully battery-electric cars do not have an internal combustion engine. In contrast  plug-in hybrids have a rechargeable battery and electric motor  and an internal combustion engine that runs on gasoline. That means a plug-in hybrid could be driven as a standard petrol car if the owner did not charge the battery. The battery in plug-in hybrids is smaller and has a shorter range than battery-electric cars  so over longer distances  the car starts running on gasoline once the battery has run out. Since plug-in hybrids will often run on petrol  they tend to emit more carbon than battery-electric cars. However  they do usually have lower emissions than petrol or diesel cars.4 In the first chart below you can see electric car sales broken down by these two technologies. This is given as a share of new cars sold each year. In the second  you will find the share of new electric cars sold that are fully battery-electric.

The Fruits-360 dataset can be downloaded from: Kagglehttps://www.kaggle.com/moltean/fruits GitHubhttps://github.com/fruits-360 Fruits and vegetables were planted in the shaft of a low-speed motor (3 rpm) and a short movie of 20 seconds was recorded. A Logitech C920 camera was used for filming the fruits. This is one of the best webcams available. Behind the fruits  we placed a white sheet of paper as a background. Here is a movie showing how the fruits and vegetables are filmed:https://youtu.be/_HFKJ144JuU However  due to the variations in the lighting conditions  the background was not uniform and we wrote a dedicated algorithm that extracts the fruit from the background. This algorithm is of flood fill type:  we start from each edge of the image and we mark all pixels there  then we mark all pixels found in the neighborhood of the already marked pixels for which the distance between colors is less than a prescribed value. We repeat the previous step until no more pixels can be marked. All marked pixels are considered as being background (which is then filled with white) and the rest of the pixels are considered as belonging to the object. The maximum value for the distance between 2 neighbor pixels is a parameter of the algorithm and is set (by trial and error) for each movie. Pictures from the test-multiple_fruits folder were taken with a Nexus 5X phone or an iPhone 11.

Epithelial cells form the lining of various tissues and organs  playing crucial roles in protection  secretion  and absorption. The image provides a detailed view of the chromosomes  essential for understanding cellular differentiation and genetic organization.Colorized Data Processing Techniques for Medical Imaging Medical images like CT scans and X-rays are typically grayscale  making subtle anatomical or pathological differences harder to distinguish. The following image processing and enhancement techniques are used to colorize and improve visual interpretation for diagnostics  training  or AI preprocessing. üî∑ 1. 3D_RenderingRenders medical image volumes into three-dimensional visualizations. Though often grayscale  color can be applied to different tissue types or densities to enhance spatial understanding. Useful in surgical planning or tumor visualization. üî∑ 2. 3D_Volume_RenderingAn advanced visualization technique that projects 3D image volumes with transparency and color blending  simulating how light passes through tissue. Color helps distinguish internal structures like organs  vessels  or tumors. üî∑ 3. Adaptive Histogram Equalization (AHE)Enhances contrast locally within the image  especially in low-contrast regions. When colorized  different intensities are mapped to distinct hues  improving visibility of fine-grained details like soft tissues or lesions. üî∑ 4. Alpha BlendingA layering technique that combines multiple images (e.g.  CT + annotation masks) with transparency. Colors represent different modalities or regions of interest  providing composite visual cues for diagnosis. üî∑ 5. Basic Color MapApplies a standard color palette (like Jet or Viridis) to grayscale data. Different intensities are mapped to different colors  enhancing the visual discrimination of anatomical or pathological regions in the image. üî∑ 6. Contrast StretchingExpands the grayscale range to improve brightness and contrast. When combined with color mapping  tissues with similar intensities become visually distinct  aiding in tasks like bone vs. soft tissue separation. üî∑ 7. Edge DetectionExtracts and overlays object boundaries (e.g.  organ or lesion outlines) on the original scan. Edge maps are typically colorized (e.g.  green or red) to highlight anatomical structures or abnormalities clearly. üî∑ 8. Gamma CorrectionAdjusts image brightness non-linearly. Color can be used to highlight underexposed or overexposed regions  often revealing soft tissue structures otherwise hidden in raw grayscale CT/X-ray images. üî∑ 9. Gaussian BlurSmooths image noise and details. When visualized with color overlays (e.g.  before vs. after)  it helps assess denoising effectiveness. It is also used in segmentation preprocessing to reduce edge artifacts. üî∑ 10. Heatmap VisualizationEncodes intensity or prediction confidence into a heatmap overlay (e.g.  red for high activity). Common in AI-assisted diagnosis to localize tumors  fractures  or infections  layered over the original grayscale image. üî∑ 11. Interactive SegmentationA semi-automated method to extract regions of interest with user input. Segmented areas are color-coded (e.g.  tumor = red  background = blue) for immediate visual confirmation and further analysis. üî∑ 12. LUT (Lookup Table) Color MapMaps grayscale values to custom color palettes using a lookup table. This enhances contrast and emphasizes certain intensity ranges (e.g.  blood vessels vs. bone)  improving interpretability for radiologists. üî∑ 13. Random Color PaletteApplies random but consistent colors to segmented regions or labels. Common in datasets with multiple classes (e.g.  liver  spleen  kidneys)  it helps in visual verification of label diversity. üß¨ ConclusionThese colorization methods do not change the underlying medical data  but they significantly enhance its interpretability for radiologists  researchers  and machine learning algorithms. Color adds clarity  contrast  and context to features that may be missed in grayscale  making it a powerful tool in modern medical imaging workflows. #Raw Data  Source  More Information ::https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yashdogra/cell-systemhttps://www.cellimagelibrary.org/home RRA_Think Differently  Create history‚Äôs next line.

Brain glioma refers to a type of tumor that originates in the glial cells of the brain  which provide support and protection to neurons. Gliomas are often aggressive and can occur in various parts of the brain  leading to symptoms like headaches  seizures  and cognitive impairments. Brain meningioma is a tumor that develops from the meninges  the layers of tissue covering the brain and spinal cord. Meningiomas are typically benign but can cause problems depending on their size and location  leading to symptoms such as vision problems  headaches  and neurological deficits. Lastly  the term brain tumor is a broad classification that includes various types of tumors that can develop in the brain  including both malignant and benign forms. Brain tumors can be primary (originating in the brain) or secondary (spreading from other parts of the body)  and they can result in diverse symptoms based on their type and location  such as motor dysfunction  memory issues  or seizures.

This dataset contains comprehensive information on 800 000 individuals related to lung cancer diagnosis  treatment  and outcomes. With 16 well-structured columns. This large-scale dataset is designed to aid researchers  data scientists  and healthcare professionals in studying patterns  building predictive models  and enhancing early detection and treatment strategies. üåç The Societal Impact of Lung Cancer Lung cancer is not just a disease ‚Äî it's a global crisis that steals time  health  and hope from millions of people every year. As the #1 cause of cancer deaths worldwide  it takes more lives annually than breast  colon  and prostate cancer combined. But behind every statistic is a story: A parent who never saw their child graduate. A worker who had to leave their job too soon. A community that lost a leader  a friend  a neighbor. Why does this matter?Lung cancer often goes undetected until it's too late. It‚Äôs aggressive  silent  and devastating ‚Äî especially in underserved areas where early detection is rare and treatment options are limited. It doesn‚Äôt just affect patients. It affects families  economies  and healthcare systems on a massive scale. This dataset represents more than numbers. It represents 800 000 real-world stories ‚Äî people who can help us unlock patterns  train models  and advance life-saving research. By working with this data  you're not just analyzing a dataset ‚Äî you're stepping into the fight against one of humanity‚Äôs deadliest diseases.

The following image processing and enhancement techniques are used to colorize and improve visual interpretation for diagnostics  training  or AI preprocessing. üî∑ 1. 3D_RenderingRenders medical image volumes into three-dimensional visualizations. Though often grayscale  color can be applied to different tissue types or densities to enhance spatial understanding. Useful in surgical planning or tumor visualization. üî∑ 2. 3D_Volume_RenderingAn advanced visualization technique that projects 3D image volumes with transparency and color blending  simulating how light passes through tissue. Color helps distinguish internal structures like organs  vessels  or tumors. üî∑ 3. Adaptive Histogram Equalization (AHE)Enhances contrast locally within the image  especially in low-contrast regions. When colorized  different intensities are mapped to distinct hues  improving visibility of fine-grained details like soft tissues or lesions. üî∑ 4. Alpha BlendingA layering technique that combines multiple images (e.g.  CT + annotation masks) with transparency. Colors represent different modalities or regions of interest  providing composite visual cues for diagnosis. üî∑ 5. Basic Color MapApplies a standard color palette (like Jet or Viridis) to grayscale data. Different intensities are mapped to different colors  enhancing the visual discrimination of anatomical or pathological regions in the image. üî∑ 6. Contrast StretchingExpands the grayscale range to improve brightness and contrast. When combined with color mapping  tissues with similar intensities become visually distinct  aiding in tasks like bone vs. soft tissue separation. üî∑ 7. Edge DetectionExtracts and overlays object boundaries (e.g.  organ or lesion outlines) on the original scan. Edge maps are typically colorized (e.g.  green or red) to highlight anatomical structures or abnormalities clearly. üî∑ 8. Gamma CorrectionAdjusts image brightness non-linearly. Color can be used to highlight underexposed or overexposed regions  often revealing soft tissue structures otherwise hidden in raw grayscale CT/X-ray images. üî∑ 9.

Metadata Collaborators Authors Coverage DOI Citation Provenance License Expected Update Frequency Activity Overview Views Downloads Engagement Comments Top Contributors Detail View Related Notebooks Similar Datasets,Diabetes is among the most prevalent chronic diseases in the United States  impacting millions of Americans each year and exerting a significant financial burden on the economy. Diabetes is a serious chronic disease in which individuals lose the ability to effectively regulate levels of glucose in the blood  and can lead to reduced quality of life and life expectancy. After different foods are broken down into sugars during digestion  the sugars are then released into the bloodstream. This signals the pancreas to release insulin. Insulin helps enable cells within the body to use those sugars in the bloodstream for energy. Diabetes is generally characterized by either the body not making enough insulin or being unable to use the insulin that is made as effectively as needed. Complications like heart disease  vision loss  lower-limb amputation  and kidney disease are associated with chronically high levels of sugar remaining in the bloodstream for those with diabetes. While there is no cure for diabetes  strategies like losing weight  eating healthily  being active  and receiving medical treatments can mitigate the harms of this disease in many patients. Early diagnosis can lead to lifestyle changes and more effective treatment  making predictive models for diabetes risk important tools for public and public health officials. The scale of this problem is also important to recognize. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has indicated that as of 2018  34.2 million Americans have diabetes and 88 million have prediabetes. Furthermore  the CDC estimates that 1 in 5 diabetics  and roughly 8 in 10 prediabetics are unaware of their risk. While there are different types of diabetes  type II diabetes is the most common form and its prevalence varies by age  education  income  location  race  and other social determinants of health. Much of the burden of the disease falls on those of lower socioeconomic status as well. Diabetes also places a massive burden on the economy  with diagnosed diabetes costs of roughly $327 billion dollars and total costs with undiagnosed diabetes and prediabetes approaching $400 billion dollars annually. The Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) is a health-related telephone survey that is collected annually by the CDC. Each year  the survey collects responses from over 400 000 Americans on health-related risk behaviors  chronic health conditions  and the use of preventative services. It has been conducted every year since 1984. For this project  a csv of the dataset available on Kaggle for the year 2015 was used. This original dataset contains responses from 441 455 individuals and has 330 features. These features are either questions directly asked of participants  or calculated variables based on individual participant responses. This dataset contains 3 files: Explore some of the following research questions: It it important to reiterate that I did not create this dataset  it is just a cleaned and consolidated dataset created from the BRFSS 2015 dataset already on Kaggle. That dataset can be foundhereand the notebook I used for the data cleaning can be foundhere. Zidian Xie et al for Building Risk Prediction Models for Type 2 Diabetes Using Machine Learning Techniques using the 2014 BRFSS was the inspiration for creating this dataset and exploring the BRFSS in general.Link

How would you describe this dataset? Metadata Collaborators Authors Coverage DOI Citation Provenance License Expected Update Frequency Activity Overview Views Downloads Engagement Comments Top Contributors Detail View Related Notebooks Similar Datasets,The World Happiness Report is a landmark survey of the state of global happiness. The first report was published in 2012  the second in 2013  the third in 2015  and the fourth in the 2016 Update. The World Happiness 2017  which ranks 155 countries by their happiness levels  was released at the United Nations at an event celebrating International Day of Happiness on March 20th. The report continues to gain global recognition as governments  organizations and civil society increasingly use happiness indicators to inform their policy-making decisions. Leading experts across fields ‚Äì economics  psychology  survey analysis  national statistics  health  public policy and more ‚Äì describe how measurements of well-being can be used effectively to assess the progress of nations. The reports review the state of happiness in the world today and show how the new science of happiness explains personal and national variations in happiness. The happiness scores and rankings use data from the Gallup World Poll. The scores are based on answers to the main life evaluation question asked in the poll. This question  known as the Cantril ladder  asks respondents to think of a ladder with the best possible life for them being a 10 and the worst possible life being a 0 and to rate their own current lives on that scale. The scores are from nationally representative samples for the years 2013-2016 and use the Gallup weights to make the estimates representative. The columns following the happiness score estimate the extent to which each of six factors ‚Äì economic production  social support  life expectancy  freedom  absence of corruption  and generosity ‚Äì contribute to making life evaluations higher in each country than they are in Dystopia  a hypothetical country that has values equal to the world‚Äôs lowest national averages for each of the six factors. They have no impact on the total score reported for each country  but they do explain why some countries rank higher than others. What countries or regions rank the highest in overall happiness and each of the six factors contributing to happiness? How did country ranks or scores change between the 2015 and 2016 as well as the 2016 and 2017 reports? Did any country experience a significant increase or decrease in happiness? What is Dystopia? Dystopia is an imaginary country that has the world‚Äôs least-happy people. The purpose in establishing Dystopia is to have a benchmark against which all countries can be favorably compared (no country performs more poorly than Dystopia) in terms of each of the six key variables  thus allowing each sub-bar to be of positive width. The lowest scores observed for the six key variables  therefore  characterize Dystopia. Since life would be very unpleasant in a country with the world‚Äôs lowest incomes  lowest life expectancy  lowest generosity  most corruption  least freedom and least social support  it is referred to as ‚ÄúDystopia ‚Äù in contrast to Utopia. What are the residuals? The residuals  or unexplained components  differ for each country  reflecting the extent to which the six variables either over- or under-explain average 2014-2016 life evaluations. These residuals have an average value of approximately zero over the whole set of countries. Figure 2.2 shows the average residual for each country when the equation in Table 2.1 is applied to average 2014- 2016 data for the six variables in that country. We combine these residuals with the estimate for life evaluations in Dystopia so that the combined bar will always have positive values. As can be seen in Figure 2.2  although some life evaluation residuals are quite large  occasionally exceeding one point on the scale from 0 to 10  they are always much smaller than the calculated value in Dystopia  where the average life is rated at 1.85 on the 0 to 10 scale. What do the columns succeeding the Happiness Score(like Family  Generosity  etc.) describe? The following columns: GDP per Capita  Family  Life Expectancy  Freedom  Generosity  Trust Government Corruption describe the extent to which these factors contribute in evaluating the happiness in each country.The Dystopia Residual metric actually is the Dystopia Happiness Score(1.85) +  the Residual value or the unexplained value for each country as stated in the previous answer. If you add all these factors up  you get the happiness score so it might be un-reliable to model them to predict Happiness Scores.

We prioritized two properties in designing this eval. First  SimpleQA is challenging  as it is adversarially collected against GPT-4 responses. Second  responses are easy to grade  because questions are created such that there exists only a single  indisputable answer. Each answer in SimpleQA is graded as either correct  incorrect  or not attempted. A model with ideal behavior would get as many questions correct as possible while not attempting the questions for which it is not confident it knows the correct answer. SimpleQA is a simple  targeted evaluation for whether models ""know what they know "" and our hope is that this benchmark will remain relevant for the next few generations of frontier models."

The images are converted from '.ppm' to '.jpg' already so no extra work required! Also the Test Image's labels are relatively hard to find and configure from the website so I did all of that and packed it into this dataset. There are a total 900 images in the dataset  out of which 600 are allotted for training and the remaining 300 for testing. In case you wondering why there are less files for labels with respect to the images  that is because not allimages contain traffic signs. So for the images with no traffic signs the text file is not present and is completely fine if you're training a YOLO model as its made to handle images with no labels. it will ignore the images with no corresponding label file.

However  clinical diagnosis of a chest X-ray can be challenging and sometimes more difficult than diagnosis via chest CT imaging. The lack of large publicly available datasets with annotations means it is still very difficult  if not impossible  to achieve clinically relevant computer-aided detection and diagnosis (CAD) in real world medical sites with chest X-rays. One major hurdle in creating large X-ray image datasets is the lack resources for labeling so many images. Prior to the release of this dataset Openiwas the largest publicly available source of chest X-ray images with 4 143 images available. This NIH Chest X-ray Dataset is comprised of 112 120 X-ray images with disease labels from 30 805 unique patients. To create these labels  the authors used Natural Language Processing to text-mine disease classifications from the associated radiological reports. The labels are expected to be >90% accurate and suitable for weakly-supervised learning. The original radiology reports are not publicly available but you can find more details on the labeling process in this Open Access paper: ""ChestX-ray8: Hospital-scale Chest X-ray Database and Benchmarks on Weakly-Supervised Classification and Localization of Common Thorax Diseases.""

Metadata Collaborators Authors Coverage DOI Citation Provenance License Expected Update Frequency Activity Overview Views Downloads Engagement Comments Top Contributors Detail View Related Notebooks Similar Datasets,Although there have been lot of studies undertaken in the past on factors affecting life expectancy considering                 demographic variables  income composition and mortality rates. It was found that affect of immunization and human                development index was not taken into account in the past. Also  some of the past research was done considering multiple                    linear regression based on data set of one year for all the countries. Hence  this gives motivation to resolve both the                     factors stated previously by formulating a regression model based on mixed effects model and multiple linear regression                 while considering data from a period of 2000 to 2015 for all the countries. Important immunization like Hepatitis B  Polio                    and Diphtheria will also be considered. In a nutshell  this study will focus on immunization factors  mortality factors                   economic factors  social factors and other health related factors as well. Since the observations this dataset are based on                   different countries  it will be easier for a country to determine the predicting factor which is contributing to lower value                    of life expectancy. This will help in suggesting a country which area should be given importance in order to efficiently                    improve the life expectancy of its population. The project relies on accuracy of data. The Global Health Observatory (GHO) data repository under World Health                 Organization (WHO) keeps track of the health status as well as many other related factors for all countries The data-sets                    are made available to public for the purpose of health data analysis. The data-set related to life expectancy  health factors                    for 193 countries has been collected from the same WHO data repository website and its corresponding economic                 data was collected from United Nation website. Among all categories of health-related factors only those critical factors were chosen which are more representative. It has been observed that in the past 15 years   there has been a huge development in health sector resulting in improvement of human mortality rates especially in the developing  nations in comparison to the past 30 years.  Therefore  in this project we have considered data from year 2000-2015 for 193 countries for further analysis. The                  individual data files have been merged together into a single data-set. On initial visual inspection of the data showed some                    missing values. As the data-sets were from WHO  we found no evident errors. Missing data was handled in R software by                     using Missmap command. The result indicated that most of the missing data was for population  Hepatitis B and GDP. The                    missing data were from less known countries like Vanuatu  Tonga  Togo  Cabo Verde etc. Finding all data for these                  countries was difficult and hence  it was decided that we exclude these countries from the final model data-set. The final                    merged file(final dataset) consists of 22 Columns and 2938 rows which meant 20 predicting variables. All predicting                 variables was then divided into several broad categories:‚ÄãImmunization related factors  Mortality factors  Economical              factors and Social factors. The data was collected from WHO and United Nations website with the help of Deeksha Russell and Duan Wang. The data-set aims to answer the following key questions:

BrowseComp comprises 1 266 questions that require persistently navigating the internet in search of hard-to-find  entangled information. Despite the difficulty of the questions  BrowseComp is simple and easy-to-use  as predicted answers are short and easily verifiable against reference answers. BrowseComp for browsing agents can be seen as analogous to how programming competitions are an incomplete but useful benchmark for coding agents. While BrowseComp sidesteps challenges of a true user query distribution  like generating long answers or resolving ambiguity  it measures the important core capability of exercising persistence and creativity in finding information.

The following image processing and enhancement techniques are used to colorize and improve visual interpretation for diagnostics  training  or AI preprocessing. üî∑ 1. 3D_RenderingRenders medical image volumes into three-dimensional visualizations. Though often grayscale  color can be applied to different tissue types or densities to enhance spatial understanding. Useful in surgical planning or tumor visualization. üî∑ 2. 3D_Volume_RenderingAn advanced visualization technique that projects 3D image volumes with transparency and color blending  simulating how light passes through tissue. Color helps distinguish internal structures like organs  vessels  or tumors. üî∑ 3. Adaptive Histogram Equalization (AHE)Enhances contrast locally within the image  especially in low-contrast regions. When colorized  different intensities are mapped to distinct hues  improving visibility of fine-grained details like soft tissues or lesions. üî∑ 4. Alpha BlendingA layering technique that combines multiple images (e.g.  CT + annotation masks) with transparency. Colors represent different modalities or regions of interest  providing composite visual cues for diagnosis. üî∑ 5. Basic Color MapApplies a standard color palette (like Jet or Viridis) to grayscale data. Different intensities are mapped to different colors  enhancing the visual discrimination of anatomical or pathological regions in the image. üî∑ 6. Contrast StretchingExpands the grayscale range to improve brightness and contrast. When combined with color mapping  tissues with similar intensities become visually distinct  aiding in tasks like bone vs. soft tissue separation. üî∑ 7. Edge DetectionExtracts and overlays object boundaries (e.g.  organ or lesion outlines) on the original scan. Edge maps are typically colorized (e.g.  green or red) to highlight anatomical structures or abnormalities clearly. üî∑ 8. Gamma CorrectionAdjusts image brightness non-linearly. Color can be used to highlight underexposed or overexposed regions  often revealing soft tissue structures otherwise hidden in raw grayscale CT/X-ray images. üî∑ 9. Gaussian BlurSmooths image noise and details. When visualized with color overlays (e.g.  before vs. after)  it helps assess denoising effectiveness. It is also used in segmentation preprocessing to reduce edge artifacts. üî∑ 10. Heatmap VisualizationEncodes intensity or prediction confidence into a heatmap overlay (e.g.  red for high activity). Common in AI-assisted diagnosis to localize tumors  fractures  or infections  layered over the original grayscale image. üî∑ 11. Interactive SegmentationA semi-automated method to extract regions of interest with user input. Segmented areas are color-coded (e.g.  tumor = red  background = blue) for immediate visual confirmation and further analysis. üî∑ 12. LUT (Lookup Table) Color MapMaps grayscale values to custom color palettes using a lookup table. This enhances contrast and emphasizes certain intensity ranges (e.g.  blood vessels vs. bone)  improving interpretability for radiologists. üî∑ 13. Random Color PaletteApplies random but consistent colors to segmented regions or labels. Common in datasets with multiple classes (e.g.  liver  spleen  kidneys)  it helps in visual verification of label diversity. üß¨ ConclusionThese colorization methods do not change the underlying medical data  but they significantly enhance its interpretability for radiologists  researchers  and machine learning algorithms. Color adds clarity  contrast  and context to features that may be missed in grayscale  making it a powerful tool in modern medical imaging workflows. Steps to Create Train/Test/Validation Splits after Image Processing These techniques can be used individually or in combination. For instance  you could apply Edge Detection and Gamma Correction to the same images to highlight structural boundaries and improve contrast. Organize Data Based on TechniquesAfter applying the image processing techniques  images should be stored in separate folders for each technique. Determine Splitting CriteriaTypically  medical datasets are split into three parts: Train Set: 70% of the data  used to train the model. Test Set: 15% of the data  used to evaluate the model‚Äôs performance on unseen data. Validation Set: 15% of the data  used during model training to tune hyperparameters. If there are fewer than 1000 images  adjust the split sizes accordingly. For example: Training Set: Take as many images as possible up to the limit (e.g.  1000).

How would you describe this dataset? Metadata Collaborators Authors Coverage DOI Citation Provenance License Expected Update Frequency Activity Overview Views Downloads Engagement Comments Top Contributors Detail View Related Notebooks Similar Datasets,This dataset provides a comprehensive  state-level view of the key factors influencing electric vehicle (EV) adoption across the United States. Compiled from authoritative sources such as the US Census Bureau  Department of Energy  National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL)  and others  it includes annual data on EV registrations  socioeconomic indicators  infrastructure availability  policy incentives  and energy prices from multiple years. The dataset is designed to support research and analysis on the drivers of EV adoption  enabling users to explore questions around policy effectiveness  infrastructure planning  and market dynamics. Context & MotivationThe transition to electric vehicles is a cornerstone of US climate and energy policy  yet EV adoption rates remain highly uneven across states. While states like California lead with robust infrastructure and incentives  other regions-particularly in the Midwest and South-lag behind. Understanding what drives these differences is crucial for policymakers  automakers  and energy providers. This dataset was created as part of a research project investigating the determinants of EV adoption. By making this data publicly available  I hope to empower further research  foster data-driven policy decisions  and encourage innovation in sustainable transportation.

BraTS 2020 utilizes multi-institutional pre-operative MRI scans and primarily focuses on the segmentation (Task 1) of intrinsically heterogeneous (in appearance  shape  and histology) brain tumors  namely gliomas. Furthemore  to pinpoint the clinical relevance of this segmentation task  BraTS‚Äô20 also focuses on the prediction of patient overall survival (Task 2)  and the distinction between pseudoprogression and true tumor recurrence (Task 3)  via integrative analyses of radiomic features and machine learning algorithms. Finally  BraTS'20 intends to evaluate the algorithmic uncertainty in tumor segmentation (Task 4). In this year's challenge  4 reference standards are used for the 4 tasks of the challenge: All BraTS multimodal scans are available as NIfTI files (.nii.gz) and describe a) native (T1) and b) post-contrast T1-weighted (T1Gd)  c) T2-weighted (T2)  and d) T2 Fluid Attenuated Inversion Recovery (T2-FLAIR) volumes  and were acquired with different clinical protocols and various scanners from multiple (n=19) institutions  mentioned as data contributors here. All the imaging datasets have been segmented manually  by one to four raters  following the same annotation protocol  and their annotations were approved by experienced neuro-radiologists. Annotations comprise the GD-enhancing tumor (ET ‚Äî label 4)  the peritumoral edema (ED ‚Äî label 2)  and the necrotic and non-enhancing tumor core (NCR/NET ‚Äî label 1)  as described both in the BraTS 2012-2013 TMI paper and in the latest BraTS summarizing paper. The provided data are distributed after their pre-processing  i.e.  co-registered to the same anatomical template  interpolated to the same resolution (1 mm^3) and skull-stripped. Participants are allowed to use additional public and/or private data (from their own institutions) for data augmentation  only if they also report results using only the BraTS'20 data and discuss any potential difference in their papers and results.

Currently  infectious diseases reduce the potential yield by an average of 40% with many farmers in the developing world experiencing yield losses as high as 100%. The widespread distribution of smartphones among crop growers around the world with an expected 5 billion smartphones by 2020 offers the potential of turning the smartphone into a valuable tool for diverse communities growing food. One potential application is the development of mobile disease diagnostics through machine learning and crowdsourcing. Here we announce the release of over 50 000 expertly curated images on healthy and infected leaves of crops plants through the existing online platform PlantVillage. We describe both the data and the platform. These data are the beginning of an on-going  crowdsourcing effort to enable computer vision approaches to help solve the problem of yield losses in crop plants due to infectious diseases.

Since Jan. 1  2015  The Washington Post has been compiling a database of every fatal shooting in the US by a police officer in the line of duty.It's difficult to find reliable data from before this period  as police killings haven't been comprehensively documented  and the statistics on police brutality are much less available. As a result  a vast number of cases go unreported. The Washington Post is tracking more than a dozen details about each killing - including the race  age and gender of the deceased  whether the person was armed  and whether the victim was experiencing a mental-health crisis. They have gathered this information from law enforcement websites  local new reports  social media  and by monitoring independent databases such as ""Killed by police"" and ""Fatal Encounters"". The Post has also conducted additional reporting in many cases. There are four additional datasets. These are US census data on poverty rate  high school graduation rate  median household income  and racial demographics.

There is no duplicate records in the proposed test sets; therefore  the performance of the learners are not biased by the methods which have better detection rates on the frequent records. The number of selected records from each difficultylevel group is inversely proportional to the percentage of records in the original KDD data set. As a result  the classification rates of distinct machine learning methods vary in a wider range  which makes it more efficient to have an accurate evaluation of different learning techniques. The number of records in the train and test sets are reasonable  which makes it affordable to run the experiments on the complete set without the need to randomly select a small portion. Consequently  evaluation results of different research works will be consistent and comparable.

FARS contains data on a census of fatal traffic crashes within the 50 States  the District of Columbia  and Puerto Rico. To be included in FARS  a crash must involve a motor vehicle traveling on a trafficway customarily open to the public and result in the death of a person (occupant of a vehicle or a non-occupant) within 30 days of the crash. FARS has been operational since 1975 and has collected information on over 989 451 motor vehicle fatalities and collects information on over 100 different coded data elements that characterizes the crash  the vehicle  and the people involved. FARS is vital to the mission of NHTSA to reduce the number of motor vehicle crashes and deaths on our nation's highways  and subsequently  reduce the associated economic loss to society resulting from those motor vehicle crashes and fatalities. FARS data is critical to understanding the characteristics of the environment  trafficway  vehicles  and persons involved in the crash. NHTSA has a cooperative agreement with an agency in each state government to provide information in a standard format on fatal crashes in the state. Data is collected  coded and submitted into a micro-computer data system and transmitted to Washington  D.C. Quarterly files are produced for analytical purposes to study trends and evaluate the effectiveness highway safety programs. There are 40 separate data tables. You can find the manual  which is too large to reprint in this space here. You can use the BigQuery Python client library to query tables in this dataset in Kernels.

A set of reasonably clean records was extracted using the following conditions: ((AAGE>16) && (AGI>100) && (AFNLWGT>1) && (HRSWK>0)).The prediction task is to determine whether a person makes over $50K a year. The weights on the Current Population Survey (CPS) files are controlled to independent estimates of the civilian noninstitutional population of the US.  These are prepared monthly for us by Population Division here at the Census Bureau. We use 3 sets of controls. These are: A single cell estimate of the population 16+ for each state. Controls for Hispanic Origin by age and sex. Controls by Race  age and sex. We use all three sets of controls in our weighting program and ""rake"" through them 6 times so that by the end we come back to all the controls we used. The term estimate refers to population totals derived from CPS by creating ""weighted tallies"" of any specified socio-economic characteristics of the population. People with similar demographic characteristics should have similar weights. There is one important caveat to remember about this statement. That is that since the CPS sample is actually a collection of 51 state samples  each with its own probability of selection  the statement only applies within state.

How would you describe this dataset? Metadata Collaborators Authors Coverage DOI Citation Provenance License Expected Update Frequency Activity Overview Views Downloads Engagement Comments Top Contributors Detail View Related Notebooks Similar Datasets,"There is a lack of public available datasets on financial services and specially in the emerging mobile money transactions domain. Financial datasets are important to many researchers and in particular to us performing research in the domain of fraud detection. Part of the problem is the intrinsically private nature of financial transactions  that leads to no publicly available datasets. We present a synthetic dataset generated using the simulator called PaySim as an approach to such a problem. PaySim uses aggregated data from the private dataset to generate a synthetic dataset that resembles the normal operation of transactions and injects malicious behaviour to later evaluate the performance of fraud detection methods. PaySim simulates mobile money transactions based on a sample of real transactions extracted from one month of financial logs from a mobile money service implemented in an African country. The original logs were provided by a multinational company  who is  the provider of the mobile financial service which is currently running in more than 14 countries all around the world. This synthetic dataset is scaled down 1/4 of the original dataset and it is created just for Kaggle. This is a sample of 1 row with headers explanation: 1 PAYMENT 1060.31 C429214117 1089.0 28.69 M1591654462 0.0 0.0 0 0 step - maps a unit of time in the real world. In this case 1 step is 1 hour of time. Total steps 744 (30 days simulation). type - CASH-IN  CASH-OUT  DEBIT  PAYMENT  and TRANSFER. amount -amount of the transaction in local currency. nameOrig - customer who started the transaction oldbalanceOrg - initial balance before the transaction newbalanceOrig - new balance after the transaction. nameDest - customer who is the recipient of the transaction oldbalanceDest - initial balance recipient before the transaction. Note that there is not information for customers that start with M (Merchants). newbalanceDest - new balance recipient after the transaction. Note that there is not information for customers that start with M (Merchants). isFraud - This is the transactions made by the fraudulent agents inside the simulation. In this specific dataset the fraudulent behavior of the agents aims to profit by taking control or customers accounts and try to empty the funds by transferring to another account and then cashing out of the system. isFlaggedFraud - The business model aims to control massive transfers from one account to another and flags illegal attempts. An illegal attempt in this dataset is an attempt to transfer more than 200.000 in a single transaction. There are 5 similar files that contain the run of 5 different scenarios. These files are better explained at my PhD thesis chapter 7 (PhD Thesis Available herehttp://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:bth-12932. We ran PaySim several times using random seeds for 744 steps  representing each hour of one month of real time  which matches the original logs. Each run took around 45 minutes on an i7 intel processor with 16GB of RAM.

This COVID-19  normal  and other lung infection dataset is released in stages. In the first release   we have released 219 COVID-19  1341 normal  and 1345 viral pneumonia chest X-ray (CXR) images. In the first update  we have increased the COVID-19 class to 1200 CXR images. In the 2nd update  we have increased the database to 3616 COVID-19 positive cases along with 10 192 Normal  6012 Lung Opacity (Non-COVID lung infection)  and 1345 Viral Pneumonia images and corresponding lung masks. We will continue to update this database as soon as we have new x-ray images for COVID-19 pneumonia patients. **COVID-QU-Ex Dataset**The researchers of Qatar University have compiled the COVID-QU-Ex dataset  which consists of 33 920 chest X-ray (CXR) images including:11 956 COVID-19  11 263 Non-COVID infections (Viral or Bacterial Pneumonia)  and 10 701 NormalGround-truth lung segmentation masks are provided for the entire dataset.

How would you describe this dataset? Metadata Collaborators Authors Coverage DOI Citation Provenance License Expected Update Frequency Activity Overview Views Downloads Engagement Comments Top Contributors Detail View Related Notebooks Similar Datasets,"What you get: *16th Oct 2016: New table containing teams' attributes from FIFA ! Original Data Source: You can easily find data about soccer matches but they are usually scattered across different websites. A thorough data collection and processing has been done to make your life easier.I must insist that you do not make any commercial use of the data. The data was sourced from: http://football-data.mx-api.enetscores.com/: scores  lineup  team formation and events http://www.football-data.co.uk/: betting odds.Click here to understand the column naming system for betting odds: http://sofifa.com/: players and teams attributes from EA Sports FIFA games.FIFA series and all FIFA assets property of EA Sports. When you have a look at the database  you will notice foreign keys forplayers and matches are the same as the original data sources. I havecalled those foreign keys ""api_id"". Improving the dataset: You will notice that some players are missing from the lineup (NULL values). This is because I have not been able to source their attributes from FIFA. This will be fixed overtime as the crawling algorithm is being improved.The dataset will also be expanded to include international games  national cups  Champion's League and Europa League. Please ask me if you're after a specific tournament. Please get in touch with me if you want to help improve this dataset. CLICK HERE TO ACCESS THE PROJECT GITHUB Important note for people interested in using the crawlers:since I first wrote the crawling scripts (in python)  it appears sofifa.com has changed its design and with it comes new requirements for the scripts. The existing script to crawl players ('Player Spider') will not work until i've updated it. Exploring the data: Now that's the fun part  there is a lot you can do with this dataset. I will be adding visuals and insights to this overview page but please have a look at the kernels and give it a try yourself ! Here are some ideas for you: The Holy Grail‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ is obviously to predict the outcome of the game. The bookies use 3 classes (Home Win  Draw  Away Win). They get it right about 53% of the time. This is also what I've achieved so far using my own SVM. Though it may sound high for such a random sport game  you've got to knowthat the home team wins about 46% of the time. So the base case (constantly predicting Home Win) has indeed 46% precision. Probabilities vs Odds When running a multi-class classifier like SVM you could also output a probability estimate and compare it to the betting odds. Have a look at your variance vs odds and see for what games you had very different predictions. Explore and visualize features With access to players and teams attributes  team formations and in-game events you should be able to produce some interesting insights intoThe Beautiful Game. Who knows  Guardiola himself may hire one of you some day!"

Metadata Collaborators Authors Coverage DOI Citation Provenance License Expected Update Frequency Activity Overview Views Downloads Engagement Comments Top Contributors Detail View Related Notebooks Similar Datasets,"Access to safe drinking-water is essential to health  a basic human right and a component of effective policy for health protection. This is important as a health and development issue at a national  regional and local level. In some regions  it has been shown that investments in water supply and sanitation can yield a net economic benefit  since the reductions in adverse health effects and health care costs outweigh the costs of undertaking the interventions. The water_potability.csv file contains water quality metrics for 3276 different water bodies. PH is an important parameter in evaluating the acid‚Äìbase balance of water. It is also the indicator of acidic or alkaline condition of water status. WHO has recommended maximum permissible limit of pH from 6.5 to 8.5. The current investigation ranges were 6.52‚Äì6.83 which are in the range of WHO standards. Hardness is mainly caused by calcium and magnesium salts. These salts are dissolved from geologic deposits through which water travels. The length of time water is in contact with hardness producing material helps determine how much hardness there is in raw water.
Hardness was originally defined as the capacity of water to precipitate soap caused by Calcium and Magnesium. Water has the ability to dissolve a wide range of inorganic and some organic minerals or salts such as potassium  calcium  sodium  bicarbonates  chlorides  magnesium  sulfates etc. These minerals produced un-wanted taste and diluted color in appearance of water. This is the important parameter for the use of water. The water with high TDS value indicates that water is highly mineralized. Desirable limit for TDS is 500 mg/l and maximum limit is 1000 mg/l which prescribed for drinking purpose. Chlorine and chloramine are the major disinfectants used in public water systems. Chloramines are most commonly formed when ammonia is added to chlorine to treat drinking water. Chlorine levels up to 4 milligrams per liter (mg/L or 4 parts per million (ppm)) are considered safe in drinking water. Sulfates are naturally occurring substances that are found in minerals  soil  and rocks. They are present in ambient air  groundwater  plants  and food. The principal commercial use of sulfate is in the chemical industry. Sulfate concentration in seawater is about 2 700 milligrams per liter (mg/L). It ranges from 3 to 30 mg/L in most freshwater supplies  although much higher concentrations (1000 mg/L) are found in some geographic locations. Pure water is not a good conductor of electric current rather‚Äôs a good insulator. Increase in ions concentration enhances the electrical conductivity of water. Generally  the amount of dissolved solids in water determines the electrical conductivity. Electrical conductivity (EC) actually measures the ionic process of a solution that enables it to transmit current. According to WHO standards  EC value should not exceeded 400 ŒºS/cm. Total Organic Carbon (TOC) in source waters comes from decaying natural organic matter (NOM) as well as synthetic sources. TOC is a measure of the total amount of carbon in organic compounds in pure water. According to US EPA < 2 mg/L as TOC in treated / drinking water  and < 4 mg/Lit in source water which is use for treatment. THMs are chemicals which may be found in water treated with chlorine. The concentration of THMs in drinking water varies according to the level of organic material in the water  the amount of chlorine required to treat the water  and the temperature of the water that is being treated. THM levels up to 80 ppm is considered safe in drinking water. The turbidity of water depends on the quantity of solid matter present in the suspended state. It is a measure of light emitting properties of water and the test is used to indicate the quality of waste discharge with respect to colloidal matter. The mean turbidity value obtained for Wondo Genet Campus (0.98 NTU) is lower than the WHO recommended value of 5.00 NTU. Indicates if water is safe for human consumption where 1 means Potable and 0 means Not potable."

Brain tumors account for 85 to 90 percent of all primary Central  Nervous  System(CNS)  tumors.   Every year   around  11 700  people are diagnosed with a brain tumor.  The 5-year survival rate for people with a cancerous brain or CNS tumor is approximately 34 percent for men and36 percent for women.  Brain Tumors are classified as: Benign Tumor  Malignant Tumor  Pituitary Tumor  etc. Proper treatment  planning  and accurate diagnostics should be implemented to improve the life expectancy of the patients. The best technique to detect brain tumors is Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). A huge amount of image data is generated through the scans. These images are examined by the radiologist. A  manual examination can be error-prone due to the level of complexities involved in brain tumors and their properties. Application of automated classification techniques using Machine Learning(ML) and Artificial Intelligence(AI)has consistently shown higher accuracy than manual classification.  Hence  proposing a system performing detection and classification by using Deep Learning Algorithms using ConvolutionNeural Network (CNN)  Artificial Neural Network (ANN)  and TransferLearning (TL) would be helpful to doctors all around the world. Brain  Tumors are complex.   There are a  lot of abnormalities in the sizes and location of the brain tumor(s).  This makes it really difficult for complete understanding of the nature of the tumor.   Also   a professional Neurosurgeon is required for MRI analysis.  Often times in developing countries the lack of skillful doctors and lack of knowledge about tumors makes it really challenging and time-consuming to generate reports from MRI‚Äô.  So an automated system on Cloud can solve this problem. To Detect and Classify Brain Tumor using  CNN and TL; as an asset of Deep Learning and to examine the tumor position(segmentation).

How would you describe this dataset? Metadata Collaborators Authors Coverage DOI Citation Provenance License Expected Update Frequency Activity Overview Views Downloads Engagement Comments Top Contributors Detail View Related Notebooks Similar Datasets,"The originalMNIST image datasetof handwritten digits is a popular benchmark for image-based machine learning methods but researchers have renewed efforts to update it and develop drop-in replacements that are more challenging for computer vision and original for real-world applications.  As noted in one recent replacement called the Fashion-MNISTdataset  the Zalandoresearchersquoted the startling claim that ""Most pairs of MNIST digits (784 total pixels per sample) can be distinguished pretty well by just one pixel"".  To stimulate the community to develop more drop-in replacements  the Sign Language MNIST is presented here and follows the same CSV format with labels and pixel values in single rows. The American Sign Language letter database of hand gestures represent a multi-class problem with 24 classes of letters (excluding J and Z which require motion). The dataset format is patterned to match closely with the classic MNIST.  Each training and test case represents a label (0-25) as a one-to-one map for each alphabetic letter A-Z (and no cases for 9=J or 25=Z because of gesture motions).  The training data (27 455 cases) and test data (7172 cases) are approximately half the size of the standard MNIST but otherwise similar with a header row of label  pixel1 pixel2‚Ä¶.pixel784 which represent a single 28x28 pixel image with grayscale values between 0-255.  The original hand gestureimage datarepresented multiple users repeating the gesture against different backgrounds.  The Sign Language MNIST data came from greatly extending the small number (1704) of the color images included as not cropped around the hand region of interest.  To create new data  an image pipeline was used based on ImageMagick and included cropping to hands-only  gray-scaling  resizing  and then creating at least 50+ variations to enlarge the quantity. The modification and expansion strategy was filters ('Mitchell'  'Robidoux'  'Catrom'  'Spline'  'Hermite')  along with 5% random pixelation  +/- 15% brightness/contrast  and finally 3 degrees rotation. Because of the tiny size of the images  these modifications effectively alter the resolution and class separation in interesting  controllable ways. This dataset was inspired by the Fashion-MNIST2and the machine learning pipeline for gestures by Sreehari4. A robust visual recognition algorithm could provide not only new benchmarks that challenge modern machine learning methods such as Convolutional Neural Nets but also could pragmatically help the deaf and hard-of-hearing better communicate using computer vision applications. The National Institute on Deafness and other Communications Disorders (NIDCD) indicates that the 200-year-old American Sign Language is a complete  complex language (of which letter gestures are only part) but is the primary language for many deaf North Americans. ASL is the leading minority language in the U.S. after the ""big four"": Spanish  Italian  German  and French.  One could implement computer vision in an inexpensive board computer like Raspberry Pi with OpenCV  and some Text-to-Speech to enabling improved and automated translation applications."

How would you describe this dataset? Metadata Collaborators Authors Coverage DOI Citation Provenance License Expected Update Frequency Activity Overview Views Downloads Engagement Comments Top Contributors Detail View Related Notebooks Similar Datasets,1.1 Industry Landscape of Fast Delivery Services in India India‚Äôs fast delivery ecosystem is characterized by intense competition among multiple players offering expedited grocery and food delivery services with promised delivery windows as low as 10 to 30 minutes. Companies such as Blinkit  Zepto  Swiggy Instamart  and JioMart have emerged as frontrunners  leveraging vast logistic networks  technology-driven supply chains  and extensive consumer data analytics (Bain & Company  2025; Expert Market Research  2024). The sector‚Äôs growth trajectory is robust  with the online food delivery market alone valued at USD 48.07 billion in 2024 and projected to grow at a CAGR of over 27% through 2034 (Expert Market Research  2024). Customer reviews and ratings provide granular feedback on delivery agents‚Äô punctuality  professionalism  order accuracy  and communication. These metrics are crucial for operational refinements  agent training  capacity planning  and enhancing customer experience (Kaggle dataset: VivekAttri  2025). Sentiment analysis applied to textual reviews further uncovers nuanced customer emotions and service pain points  enabling predictive insights and proactive service improvements. The focal dataset includes structured customer reviews and numerical ratings collected for fast delivery agents across India‚Äôs leading quick-commerce platforms. Key variables encompass agent identity  delivery timestamps  rating scores (typically on a 1-5 scale)  customer comments  and transactional metadata (VivekAttri  2025). This dataset serves as the foundation for exploratory data analysis  machine learning modeling  and visualization aimed at performance benchmarking and predictive analytics. The dataset is sourced from Kaggle repositories aggregating customer feedback across platforms  with metadata ensuring temporal  geographic  and service-specific contextualization. Effective data ingestion involves automated pipelines utilizing Python libraries such as Pandas for dataframes and requests for API interfacing (MinakshiDhhote  2025). Critical preprocessing steps include: Removal of Redundant and Irrelevant Columns:Columns unrelated to delivery agent performance (e.g.  user identifiers when anonymized) are discarded to streamline analysis. Handling Missing Values:Rows with null or missing ratings/reviews are either imputed using domain-specific heuristics or removed to maintain data integrity. Duplicate Records Elimination:To prevent bias  identical reviews or ratings are deduplicated. Text Cleaning for Reviews:Natural language preprocessing (NLP) techniques such as tokenization  stopword removal  lemmatization  and spell correction are applied to textual data to prepare for sentiment analysis. Standardization of Rating Scales:Ensuring uniformity when ratings come from different sources with varying scales. Derived features enhance modeling capabilities: Sentiment Scores:Using models like VADER or BERT-based classifiers to convert textual reviews into quantifiable sentiment metrics. Delivery Time Buckets:Categorization of delivery durations into intervals (e.g.  under 15 minutes  15-30 minutes) to analyze performance impact. Agent Activity Levels:Number of deliveries per agent to assess workload-performance correlation. Temporal Features:Time of day  day of week  and seasonal effects considered for delivery performance trends. A comprehensive statistical summary outlines mean ratings  variance  skewness  and kurtosis to understand central tendencies and rating dispersion among delivery agents. Table 1: Rating Summary Statistics for Delivery Agents (2025 Dataset Sample) Data validated with 95% confidence interval from Kaggle 2025 dataset (VivekAttri  2025). Heatmaps and bar charts illustrate rating variations across cities and platforms. For instance  Blinkit shows higher average ratings in metropolitan regions compared to tier-2 cities  reflecting infrastructural disparities. Scatter plots and correlation matrices reveal relationships between agent rating and delivery time  order volume  and customer sentiment scores. Early results indicate a strong negative correlation (r = -0.65) between delayed deliveries and customer ratings. Sentiment polarity distribution across reviews indicates a predominance of neutral to positive sentiments  with negative sentiments clustering around delivery delays and product quality issues. Two core predictive tasks are identified: Regression Task:Predicting continuous delivery agent rating scores based on service and contextual features. Classification Task:Categorizing agents into performance bins (e.g.  low  medium  high) for targeted interventions. Baseline Models:Linear Regression and Random Forest Regressors for initial benchmarking. Advanced Models:Gradient Boosting Machines (XGBoost)  and Neural Networks fine-tuned for regression tasks. Textual Feature Integration:BERT embeddings incorporated into hybrid models to utilize review text for enhanced prediction accuracy. Stratified k-fold cross-validation ensures model robustness across diverse data segments. Hyperparameter tuning via grid search optimizes model performance metrics such as RMSE and F1-score. Regularization techniques mitigate overfitting  especially in high-dimensional feature spaces. Table 2: Model Performance Comparison on Test Dataset Performance validated on a holdout sample of 20 000 ratings with 95% confidence (VivekAttri  2025). Accurate prediction of delivery agent ratings and identification of service bottlenecks enable logistics managers to optimize agent deployment  training  and incentive structures  thereby improving customer satisfaction and reducing operational costs (Reza Toorajipour et al.  2021). Sentiment-informed feedback loops facilitate personalized customer engagement strategies. Real-time monitoring of agent performance metrics supports proactive issue resolution  reducing negative experiences and cart abandonment rates (Set Predictive Delivery Promise  parcelLab  2025). Delivery platforms can leverage data-driven insights to refine marketing  price positioning  and service level agreements (SLAs). Predictive analytics inform expansion strategies into underserved geographies with calibrated agent capacity (Eternal Q4 Report  2025). The Kaggle notebook designed here offers a practical pedagogical framework combining EDA  NLP  and machine learning methodologies  tailored for practitioners and students focusing on logistics analytics and customer feedback systems (Machine Learning with Python Projects  PHD Services  2025). The notebook architecture encourages open-source collaboration and reproducibility  facilitating community-driven enhancements and benchmarking against emerging datasets and algorithms. Section 1: Data Loading and Initial Inspection Section 2: Data Cleaning and Preprocessing Section 3: Exploratory Data Analysis Section 4: Machine Learning Modeling Section 5: Sentiment Analysis Section 6: Predictive Insights and Recommendations Section 7: Summary and Export Integration of AI-powered dynamic routing and agent performance prediction models will further enhance delivery reliability and speed (Salesforce AI Research  2025). Combining delivery agent reviews with IoT-based sensor data (e.g.  GPS  temperature monitors) can yield deeper insights into delivery conditions and service quality. Ensuring data privacy and mitigating algorithmic biases in rating predictions are critical for sustaining trust and regulatory compliance in AI-driven delivery services. Blinkit integrated a machine learning model trained on customer reviews to identify low-performing agents in real time. Post-implementation  average delivery ratings improved by 12%  and customer complaints reduced by 18% over a six-month period (Eternal Q4 Report  2025). Swiggy Instamart employed sentiment analysis on delivery agent reviews to personalize customer support interventions. This led to a 9% increase in repeat orders and a 15% reduction in negative feedback cycles within three months (Kaggle Dataset Analysis  VivekAttri  2025). Zomato‚Äôs attempt to launch a 15-minute delivery service ‚ÄòQuick‚Äô was discontinued after four months due to infrastructural and profitability challenges linked to inconsistent delivery experiences (Livemint  2025). This underscores the importance of aligning operational capabilities with customer expectations and data-driven performance metrics. Machine learning models not only optimize delivery logistics but also shape strategic business decisions  marketing  and investment priorities. Upskilling delivery agents through data-driven training programs informed by performance analytics enhances service quality and employee engagement. The evolving regulatory landscape  consumer behavior shifts post-pandemic  and rapid technological adoption continuously reshape the fast delivery market  necessitating agile and data-centric approaches. Customer reviews and ratings provide critical  actionable data to improve delivery agent performance and customer satisfaction. Advanced machine learning models incorporating textual sentiment analysis outperform traditional models in predicting delivery agent ratings. Geographical and infrastructural disparities significantly affect delivery agent performance  warranting region-specific strategies. Business profitability and customer experience improvements are tightly coupled with data-driven operational excellence. The designed Kaggle notebook offers a replicable  comprehensive framework for ongoing analysis and model development. Future developments should focus on real-time data integration  AI-driven logistics  and ethical AI deployment. Bain & Company. (2025).

Metadata Collaborators Authors Coverage DOI Citation Provenance License Expected Update Frequency Activity Overview Views Downloads Engagement Comments Top Contributors Detail View Related Notebooks Similar Datasets,Market Basket Analysis is one of the key techniques used by large retailers to uncover associations between items. It works by looking for combinations of items that occur together frequently in transactions. To put it another way  it allows retailers to identify relationships between the items that people buy. Association Rules are widely used to analyze retail basket or transaction data and are intended to identify strong rules discovered in transaction data using measures of interestingness  based on the concept of strong rules. The dataset has 38765 rows of the purchase orders of people from the grocery stores. These orders can be analysed and association rules can be generated using Market Basket Analysis by algorithms like Apriori Algorithm. Apriori is an algorithm for frequent itemset mining and association rule learning over relational databases. It proceeds by identifying the frequent individual items in the database and extending them to larger and larger item sets as long as those item sets appear sufficiently often in the database. The frequent itemsets determined by Apriori can be used to determine association rules which highlight general trends in the database: this has applications in domains such as market basket analysis. Assume there are 100 customers10 of them bought milk  8 bought butter and 6 bought both of them.bought milk => bought buttersupport = P(Milk & Butter) = 6/100 = 0.06confidence = support/P(Butter) = 0.06/0.08 = 0.75lift = confidence/P(Milk) = 0.75/0.10 = 7.5 Note: this example is extremely small. In practice  a rule needs the support of several hundred transactions  before it can be considered statistically significant  and datasets often contain thousands or millions of transactions. Support: This says how popular an itemset is  as measured by the proportion of transactions in which an itemset appears. Confidence: This says how likely item Y is purchased when item X is purchased  expressed as {X -> Y}. This is measured by the proportion of transactions with item X  in which item Y also appears. Lift: This says how likely item Y is purchased when item X is purchased while controlling for how popular item Y is.

This data was downloaded from the Hass Avocado Board website in May of 2018 & compiled into a single CSV. Here's how theHass Avocado Board describes the data on their website: The table below represents weekly 2018 retail scan data for National retail volume (units) and price. Retail scan data comes directly from retailers‚Äô cash registers based on actual retail sales of Hass avocados. Starting in 2013  the table below reflects an expanded  multi-outlet retail data set. Multi-outlet reporting includes an aggregation of the following channels: grocery  mass  club  drug  dollar and military. The Average Price (of avocados) in the table reflects a per unit (per avocado) cost  even when multiple units (avocados) are sold in bags. The Product Lookup codes (PLU‚Äôs) in the table are only for Hass avocados. Other varieties of avocados (e.g. greenskins) are not included in this table. Some relevant columns in the dataset: Many thanks to the Hass Avocado Board for sharing this data!! http://www.hassavocadoboard.com/retail/volume-and-price-data In which cities can millenials have their avocado toast AND buy a home? Was the Avocadopocalypse of 2017 real?

From e-commerce (suggest to buyers articles that could interest them) to online advertisement (suggest to users the right contents  matching their preferences)  recommender systems are today unavoidable in our daily online journeys.In a very general way  recommender systems are algorithms aimed at suggesting relevant items to users (items being movies to watch  text to read  products to buy or anything else depending on industries). Recommender systems are really critical in some industries as they can generate a huge amount of income when they are efficient or also be a way to stand out significantly from competitors. As a proof of the importance of recommender systems  we can mention that  a few years ago  Netflix organised a challenges (the ‚ÄúNetflix prize‚Äù) where the goal was to produce a recommender system that performs better than its own algorithm with a prize of 1 million dollars to win.

The following image processing and enhancement techniques are used to colorize and improve visual interpretation for diagnostics  training  or AI preprocessing. üî∑ 1. 3D_RenderingRenders medical image volumes into three-dimensional visualizations. Though often grayscale  color can be applied to different tissue types or densities to enhance spatial understanding. Useful in surgical planning or tumor visualization. üî∑ 2. 3D_Volume_RenderingAn advanced visualization technique that projects 3D image volumes with transparency and color blending  simulating how light passes through tissue. Color helps distinguish internal structures like organs  vessels  or tumors. üî∑ 3. Adaptive Histogram Equalization (AHE)Enhances contrast locally within the image  especially in low-contrast regions. When colorized  different intensities are mapped to distinct hues  improving visibility of fine-grained details like soft tissues or lesions. üî∑ 4. Alpha BlendingA layering technique that combines multiple images (e.g.  CT + annotation masks) with transparency. Colors represent different modalities or regions of interest  providing composite visual cues for diagnosis. üî∑ 5. Basic Color MapApplies a standard color palette (like Jet or Viridis) to grayscale data. Different intensities are mapped to different colors  enhancing the visual discrimination of anatomical or pathological regions in the image. üî∑ 6. Contrast StretchingExpands the grayscale range to improve brightness and contrast. When combined with color mapping  tissues with similar intensities become visually distinct  aiding in tasks like bone vs. soft tissue separation. üî∑ 7. Edge DetectionExtracts and overlays object boundaries (e.g.  organ or lesion outlines) on the original scan. Edge maps are typically colorized (e.g.  green or red) to highlight anatomical structures or abnormalities clearly. üî∑ 8. Gamma CorrectionAdjusts image brightness non-linearly. Color can be used to highlight underexposed or overexposed regions  often revealing soft tissue structures otherwise hidden in raw grayscale CT/X-ray images. üî∑ 9. Gaussian BlurSmooths image noise and details. When visualized with color overlays (e.g.  before vs. after)  it helps assess denoising effectiveness. It is also used in segmentation preprocessing to reduce edge artifacts. üî∑ 10. Heatmap VisualizationEncodes intensity or prediction confidence into a heatmap overlay (e.g.  red for high activity). Common in AI-assisted diagnosis to localize tumors  fractures  or infections  layered over the original grayscale image. üî∑ 11. Interactive SegmentationA semi-automated method to extract regions of interest with user input. Segmented areas are color-coded (e.g.  tumor = red  background = blue) for immediate visual confirmation and further analysis. üî∑ 12. LUT (Lookup Table) Color MapMaps grayscale values to custom color palettes using a lookup table. This enhances contrast and emphasizes certain intensity ranges (e.g.  blood vessels vs. bone)  improving interpretability for radiologists. üî∑ 13. Random Color PaletteApplies random but consistent colors to segmented regions or labels. Common in datasets with multiple classes (e.g.  liver  spleen  kidneys)  it helps in visual verification of label diversity. üß¨ ConclusionThese colorization methods do not change the underlying medical data  but they significantly enhance its interpretability for radiologists  researchers  and machine learning algorithms. Color adds clarity  contrast  and context to features that may be missed in grayscale  making it a powerful tool in modern medical imaging workflows. Steps to Create Train/Test/Validation Splits after Image Processing These techniques can be used individually or in combination. For instance  you could apply Edge Detection and Gamma Correction to the same images to highlight structural boundaries and improve contrast. Organize Data Based on TechniquesAfter applying the image processing techniques  images should be stored in separate folders for each technique. Determine Splitting CriteriaTypically  medical datasets are split into three parts: Train Set: 70% of the data  used to train the model. Test Set: 15% of the data  used to evaluate the model‚Äôs performance on unseen data. Validation Set: 15% of the data  used during model training to tune hyperparameters. If there are fewer than 1000 images  adjust the split sizes accordingly. For example: Training Set: Take as many images as possible up to the limit (e.g.  1000). Test and Validation Sets: Fill the remaining slots with the next 200 images for each. The randomization can be done using tools like Python's random.shuffle(). #Raw Data  Source  More Information ::Rahman  Md Mizanur (2024)  ‚ÄúBrain Cancer -  MRI dataset‚Äù  Mendeley Data  V1  doi: 10.17632/mk56jw9rns.1https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/mk56jw9rns/1 RRA_Think Differently  Create history‚Äôs next line.

So I took it upon myself to collect it for my own use. I might as well share it. This dataset includes47 917results of international football matches starting from the very first official match in 1872 up to 2025. The matches range from FIFA World Cup to FIFI Wild Cup to regular friendly matches. The matches are strictly men's full internationals and the data does not include Olympic Games or matches where at least one of the teams was the nation's B-team  U-23 or a league select team. results.csvincludes the following columns: shootouts.csvincludes the following columns: goalscorers.csvincludes the following columns: former_names.csvincludes the following columns: This notebookshows the basics of how to useformer_names.csv Note on team and country names: For home and away teams thecurrentname of the team has been used. For example  when in 1882 a team who called themselves Ireland played against England  in this dataset  it is called Northern Ireland because the current team of Northern Ireland is the successor of the 1882 Ireland team. This is done so it is easier to track the history and statistics of teams. For country names  the name of the countryat the time of the matchis used. So when Ghana played in Accra  Gold Coast in the 1950s  even though the names of the home team and the country don't match  it was a home match for Ghana. This is indicated by the neutral column  which says FALSE for those matches  meaning it wasnotat a neutral venue.

It has the heftiest temporal coverage  spanning over 13 years  includes over 15 million tweets spatially distributed across the world  and provides the geolocation of most tweets. Seven dimensions of information are tied to each tweet  namely geolocation  user gender  climate change stance and sentiment  aggressiveness  deviations from historic temperature  and topic modeling  while accompanied by environmental disaster events information. These dimensions were produced by testing and evaluating a plethora of state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms and methods  both supervised and unsupervised  including BERT  RNN  LSTM  CNN  SVM  Naive Bayes  VADER  Textblob  Flair  and LDA. The following columns are in the dataset: ‚û° created_at: The timestamp of the tweet.‚û° id: The unique id of the tweet.‚û° lng: The longitude the tweet was written.‚û° lat: The latitude the tweet was written.‚û° topic: Categorization of the tweet in one of ten topics namely  seriousness of gas emissions  importance of human intervention  global stance  significance of pollution awareness events  weather extremes  impact of resource overconsumption  Donald Trump versus science  ideological positions on global warming  politics  and undefined.‚û° sentiment: A score on a continuous scale. This scale ranges from -1 to 1 with values closer to 1 being translated to positive sentiment  values closer to -1 representing a negative sentiment while values close to 0 depicting no sentiment or being neutral.‚û° stance: That is if the tweet supports the belief of man-made climate change (believer)  if the tweet does not believe in man-made climate change (denier)  and if the tweet neither supports nor refuses the belief of man-made climate change (neutral).‚û° gender: Whether the user that made the tweet is male  female  or undefined.‚û° temperature_avg: The temperature deviation in Celsius and relative to the January 1951-December 1980 average at the time and place the tweet was written.‚û° aggressiveness: That is if the tweet contains aggressive language or not. Since Twitter forbids making public the text of the tweets  in order to retrieve it you need to do a process called hydrating. Tools such as Twarc or Hydrator can be used to hydrate tweets.

This simulation was run for the duration - 1 Jan 2019 to 31 Dec 2020. The files were combined and converted into a standard format. I do not own the simulator. I used the one used by Brandon Harris and just to understand how it works  I went through few portions of the code. This is what I understood from what I read: The simulator has certain pre-defined list of merchants  customers and transaction categories. And then using a python library called ""faker""  and with the number of customers  merchants that you mention during simulation  an intermediate list is created. After this  depending on the profile you choose for e.g. ""adults 2550 female rural.json"" (which means simulation properties of adult females in the age range of 25-50 who are from rural areas)  the transactions are created. Say  for this profile  you could check""Sparkov | Github | adults_2550_female_rural.json""  there are parameter value ranges defined in terms of min  max transactions per day  distribution of transactions across days of the week and normal distribution properties (mean  standard deviation) for amounts in various categories. Using these measures of distributions  the transactions are generated using faker. What I did was generate transactions across all profiles and then merged them together to create a more realistic representation of simulated transactions."

We are turning some of the data over to you so you can form your own view. (opens in a new tab)""> Even more than with other data sets that Kaggle has featured  there‚Äôs a huge amount of data cleaning and preparation that goes into putting together a long-time study of climate trends. Early data was collected by technicians using mercury thermometers  where any variation in the visit time impacted measurements. In the 1940s  the construction of airports caused many weather stations to be moved. In the 1980s  there was a move to electronic thermometers that are said to have a cooling bias. Given this complexity  there are a range of organizations that collate climate trends data. The three most cited land and ocean temperature data sets are NOAA‚Äôs MLOST  NASA‚Äôs GISTEMP and the UK‚Äôs HadCrut. We have repackaged the data from a newer compilation put together by theBerkeley Earth  which is affiliated with Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. The Berkeley Earth Surface Temperature Study combines 1.6 billion temperature reports from 16 pre-existing archives. It is nicely packaged and allows for slicing into interesting subsets (for example by country). They publish the source data and the code for the transformations they applied. They also use methods that allow weather observations from shorter time series to be included  meaning fewer observations need to be thrown away. In this dataset  we have include several files: Global Land and Ocean-and-Land Temperatures (GlobalTemperatures.csv): Other files include: The raw data comes from theBerkeley Earth data page."

The virus did not match any other known virus. This raised concern because when a virus is new  we do not know how it affects people. So daily level information on the affected people can give some interesting insights when it is made available to the broader data science community. Johns Hopkins University has made an excellent dashboardusing the affected cases data. Data is extracted from the google sheets associated and made available here. Edited:Now data is available as csv files in theJohns Hopkins Github repository. Please refer to the github repository for theTerms of Usedetails. Uploading it here for using it in Kaggle kernels and getting insights from the broader DS community. 2019 Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) is a virus (more specifically  a coronavirus) identified as the cause of an outbreak of respiratory illness first detected in Wuhan  China. Early on  many of the patients in the outbreak in Wuhan  China reportedly had some link to a large seafood and animal market  suggesting animal-to-person spread. However  a growing number of patients reportedly have not had exposure to animal markets  indicating person-to-person spread is occurring. At this time  it‚Äôs unclear how easily or sustainably this virus is spreading between people -CDC This dataset has daily level information on the number of affected cases  deaths and recovery from 2019 novel coronavirus.

Each year  residents of the United States collectively eat more than 2.8 billions pounds. However  not all chocolate bars are created equal! This dataset contains expert ratings of over 1 700 individual chocolate bars  along with information on their regional origin  percentage of cocoa  the variety of chocolate bean used and where the beans were grown. Each chocolate is evaluated from a combination of both objective qualities and subjective interpretation. A rating here only represents an experience with one bar from one batch. Batch numbers  vintages and review dates are included in the database when known. The database is narrowly focused on plain dark chocolate with an aim of appreciating the flavors of the cacao when made into chocolate. The ratings do not reflect health benefits  social missions  or organic status. Flavoris the most important component of the Flavors of Cacao ratings. Diversity  balance  intensity and purity of flavors are all considered. It is possible for a straight forward single note chocolate to rate as high as a complex flavor profile that changes throughout. Genetics  terroir  post harvest techniques  processing and storage can all be discussed when considering the flavor component. Texturehas a great impact on the overall experience and it is also possible for texture related issues to impact flavor. It is a good way to evaluate the makers vision  attention to detail and level of proficiency. Aftermeltis the experience after the chocolate has melted. Higher quality chocolate will linger and be long lasting and enjoyable. Since the aftermelt is the last impression you get from the chocolate  it receives equal importance in the overall rating. OverallOpinion is really where the ratings reflect a subjective opinion. Ideally it is my evaluation of whether or not the components above worked together and an opinion on the flavor development  character and style. It is also here where each chocolate can usually be summarized by the most prominent impressions that you would remember about each chocolate. These ratings were compiled by Brady Brelinski  Founding Member of the Manhattan Chocolate Society. For up-to-date information  as well as additional content (including interviews with craft chocolate makers)  please see his website:Flavors of Cacao

What's interesting is that this dataset is female only and is of very high quality audio. Most of the other dataset is skewed towards male speakers and thus brings about a slightly imbalance representation. So because of that  this dataset would serve a very good training dataset for the emotion classifier in terms of generalisation (not overfitting) There are a set of 200 target words were spoken in the carrier phrase ""Say the word_' by two actresses (aged 26 and 64 years) and recordings were made of the set portraying each of seven emotions (anger  disgust  fear  happiness  pleasant surprise  sadness  and neutral). There are 2800 data points (audio files) in total. The dataset is organised such that each of the two female actor and their emotions are contain within its own folder. And within that  all 200 target words audio file can be found. The format of the audio file is a WAV format I wanted to thank University of Toronto for putting together this awesomedataset!"

The idea here is a dataset is more than a toy - real business data on a reasonable scale - but can be trained in minutes on a modest laptop. ThefastText supervised learning tutorialrequires data in the following format: where X and Y are the class names.  No quotes  all on one line. In this case  the classes are__label__1and__label__2  and there is only one class per row. __label__1corresponds to 1- and 2-star reviews  and__label__2corresponds to 4- and 5-star reviews. (3-star reviews i.e. reviews with neutral sentiment were not included in the original)  The review titles  followed by ':' and a space  are prepended to the text. Most of the reviews are in English  but there are a few in other languages  like Spanish. The data was lifted fromXiang Zhang's Google Drive dir  but it was in .csv format  not suitable for fastText. Follow the basic instructions atfastText supervised learning tutorialto set up the directory. To train: This should take a few minutes. To test: Expect precision and recall of 0.916 if all is in order. You can also train and test in Python  see Kernel.

Usability License Expected update frequency Tags 2020(1 files) Data Explorer Summary See what others are saying about this dataset What have you used this dataset for?

Metadata Collaborators Authors Coverage DOI Citation Provenance License Expected Update Frequency Activity Overview Views Downloads Engagement Comments Top Contributors Detail View Related Notebooks Similar Datasets,"According to theCDC  heart disease is a leading cause of death for people of most races in the U.S. (African Americans  American Indians and Alaska Natives  and whites). About half of all Americans (47%) have at least 1 of 3 major risk factors for heart disease: high blood pressure  high cholesterol  and smoking. Other key indicators include diabetes status  obesity (high BMI)  not getting enough physical activity  or drinking too much alcohol. Identifying and preventing the factors that have the greatest impact on heart disease is very important in healthcare. In turn  developments in computing allow the application of machine learning methods to detect ""patterns"" in the data that can predict a patient's condition. The dataset originally comes from the CDC and is a major part of the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS)  which conducts annual telephone surveys to collect data on the health status of U.S. residents. As described by theCDC: ""Established in 1984 with 15 states  BRFSS now collects data in all 50 states  the District of Columbia  and three U.S. territories. BRFSS completes more than 400 000 adult interviews each year  making it the largest continuously conducted health survey system in the world. The most recent dataset includes data from 2023. In this dataset  I noticed many factors (questions) that directly or indirectly influence heart disease  so I decided to select the most relevant variables from it. I also decided to share with you two versions of the most recent dataset: with NaNs and without it. As described above  the original dataset of nearly 300 variables was reduced to 40variables. In addition to classical EDA  this dataset can be used to apply a number of machine learning methods  especially classifier models (logistic regression  SVM  random forest  etc.). You should treat the variable ""HadHeartAttack"" as binary (""Yes"" - respondent had heart disease; ""No"" - respondent did not have heart disease). Note  however  that the classes are unbalanced  so the classic approach of applying a model is not advisable. Fixing the weights/undersampling should yield much better results. Based on the data set  I built a logistic regression model and embedded it in an application that might inspire you:https://share.streamlit.io/kamilpytlak/heart-condition-checker/main/app.py. Can you indicate which variables have a significant effect on the likelihood of heart disease?

Metadata Collaborators Authors Coverage DOI Citation Provenance License Expected Update Frequency Activity Overview Views Downloads Engagement Comments Top Contributors Detail View Similar Datasets,Submitted to NeurIPS D&B Track 2025 FUSEP: A Multi-Center Benchmark for Diverse Tasks in Fetal Ultrasound Screening Early Pregnancy. A large number of infants with congenital anomalies are born each year globally  especially in areas with underdeveloped medical resources.Currently  fetal ultrasound screening is the most common modality for early pregnancy anatomy detection. This modality can detect anomalies earlier and provide opportune treatment advice. However  the lack of the ultrasound dataset on early fetal gestation has slowed down the development of automated assisted diagnosis. In this work  we present a benchmark dataset for Fetal Ultrasound SScreening in EarlyPregnancy to facilitate intelligent ultrasound examination and assisted diagnosis called FUSEP. Our dataset consists of two ultrasound views recommended by the international guideline  i.e.  Crown-rump Length (CRL) and Nuchal Translucency (NT) views in three hospitals  totaling 4 017 ultrasound images  with 45 820 box-level expert-level annotations. Our dataset and baseline present the following three contributions:1) Our medical experts annotated a total of 14 key anatomical structures in two views using a box-level format;2) Our data is collected extensively from different sonographers  devices  scanning angles  weeks of gestation  hospitals  etc;3) We report the performance of the semi-supervised learning  fully supervised learning  unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA)  and source-free UDA in ultrasound images multi-object detection.To the best of our knowledge  this is the first publicly available dataset and benchmark for fetal early pregnancy ultrasound screening.We believe that FUSEP and benchmark can contribute to the medical community in the development of multiple tasks such as standard plane recognition  quality control on ultrasound images  automated assisted diagnostics in early fetal pregnancy  medical multi-object detection  domain adaptation for object detection  etc.

How would you describe this dataset? Metadata Collaborators Authors Coverage DOI Citation Provenance License Expected Update Frequency Activity Overview Views Downloads Engagement Comments Top Contributors Detail View Related Notebooks Similar Datasets,The Flickr30k dataset has become a standard benchmark for sentence-based image description. This paper presents Flickr30k Entities  which augments the 158k captions from Flickr30k with 244k coreference chains  linking mentions of the same entities across different captions for the same image  and associating them with 276k manually annotated bounding boxes. Such annotations are essential for continued progress in automatic image description and grounded language understanding. They enable us to define a new benchmark for localization of textual entity mentions in an image. We present a strong baseline for this task that combines an image-text embedding  detectors for common objects  a color classifier  and a bias towards selecting larger objects. While our baseline rivals in accuracy more complex state-of-the-art models  we show that its gains cannot be easily parlayed into improvements on such tasks as image-sentence retrieval  thus underlining the limitations of current methods and the need for further research.

The amount of financial data on the web is seemingly endless. A large and well structured dataset on a wide array of companies can be hard to come by. Here I provide a dataset with historical stock prices (last 5 years) for all companies currently found on the S&P 500 index. The script I used to acquire all of these .csv files can be foundin this GitHub repositoryIn the future if you wish for a more up to date dataset  this can be used to acquire new versions of the .csv files. Feb 2018 note: I have just updated the dataset to include data up to Feb 2018. I have also accounted for changes in the stocks on the S&P 500 index (RIP whole foods etc. etc.). The data is presented in a couple of formats to suit different individual's needs or computational limitations. I have included files containing 5 years of stock data (in the all_stocks_5yr.csv and corresponding folder). The folder individual_stocks_5yr contains files of data for individual stocks  labelled by their stock ticker name. The all_stocks_5yr.csv contains the same data  presented in a merged .csv file. Depending on the intended use (graphing  modelling etc.) the user may prefer one of these given formats. All the files have the following columns:Date - in format: yy-mm-dd Open - price of the stock at market open (this is NYSE data so all in USD) High - Highest price reached in the day Low    Close - Lowest price reached in the day Volume - Number of shares traded Name - the stock's ticker name Due to volatility in google finance  for the newest version I have switched over to acquiring the data from The Investor's Exchange api  the simple script I use to do this is foundhere. Special thanks to Kaggle  Github  pandas_datareader and The Market. This dataset lends itself to a some very interesting visualizations. One can look at simple things like how prices change over time  graph an compare multiple stocks at once  or generate and graph new metrics from the data provided.From these data informative stock stats such as volatility and moving averages can be easily calculated.The million dollar question is: can you develop a model that can beat the market and allow you to make statistically informed trades!

For the purposes of sharing  please follow this license: CC-BY-NC-NDThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International License. https://rpubs.com/rhuebner/hrd_cb_v14 PLEASE NOTE -- I recently updated the codebook - please use the above link.  A few minor discrepancies were identified between the codebook and the dataset.  Please feel free to contact me through LinkedIn (www.linkedin.com/in/RichHuebner) to report discrepancies and make requests. HR data can be hard to come by  and HR professionals generally lag behind with respect to analytics and data visualization competency. Thus  Dr. Carla Patalano and I set out to create our own HR-related dataset  which is used in one of our graduate MSHRM courses called HR Metrics and Analytics  at New England College of Business. We created this data set ourselves. We use the data set to teach HR students how to use and analyze the data in Tableau Desktop - a data visualization tool that's easy to learn. This version provides a variety of features that are useful for both data visualization AND creating machine learning / predictive analytics models.  We are working on expanding the data set even further by generating even more records and a few additional features. We will be keeping this as one file/one data set for now. There is a possibility of creating a second file perhaps down the road where you can join the files together to practice SQL/joins  etc. Note that this dataset isn't perfect. By design  there are some issues that are present.  It is primarily designed as a teaching data set - to teach human resources professionals how to work with data and analytics. We have reduced the complexity of the dataset down to a single data file (v14). The CSV revolves around a fictitious company and the core data set contains names  DOBs  age  gender  marital status  date of hire  reasons for termination  department  whether they are active or terminated  position title  pay rate  manager name  and performance score. Recent additions to the data include: Dr. Carla Patalano provided the baseline idea for creating this synthetic data set  which has been used now by over 200 Human Resource Management students at the college. Students in the course learn data visualization techniques with Tableau Desktop and use this data set to complete a series of assignments. We've included some open-ended questions that you can explore and try to address through creating Tableau visualizations  or R or Python analyses. Good luck and enjoy the learning! There are so many other interesting questions that could be addressed through this interesting data set. Dr. Patalano and I look forward to seeing what we can come up with.

Over 1.5 million living animal species have been described‚Äîof which around 1 million are insects‚Äîbut it has been estimated there are over 7 million animal species in total. Animals range in length from 8.5 micrometers (0.00033 in) to 33.6 meters (110 ft). They have complex interactions with each other and their environments  forming intricate food webs. The scientific study of animals is known as zoology. Most living animal species are in Bilateria  a clade whose members have a bilaterally symmetric body plan. The Bilateria include the protostomes‚Äîin which many groups of invertebrates are found  such as nematodes  arthropods  and mollusks‚Äîand the deuterostomes  containing both the echinoderms as well as the chordates  the latter containing the vertebrates. Life forms interpreted as early animals were present in the Ediacaran biota of the late Precambrian. Many modern animal phyla became clearly established in the fossil record as marine species during the Cambrian explosion  which began around 542 million years ago. 6 331 groups of genes common to all living animals have been identified; these may have arisen from a single common ancestor that lived 650 million years ago.

I ran a data set quality evaluation program on the previous version which found a considerable number of duplicate and near duplicate images. Duplicate images can lead to falsely higher values of validation and test set accuracy and I have eliminated these images in this version of the dataset.Images were gathered from internet searches. The images were scanned with  a duplicate image detector program I wrote. Any duplicate images were removed to prevent bleed through of images between the train  test and valid data sets. All images were then resized to 224 X224 X 3 and converted to jpg format.  A csv file is included that for each image file contains the relative path to the image file  the image file class label and the dataset (train  test or valid) that the image file resides in. This is a clean dataset. If you build a good model you should achieve at least 95% accuracy on the test set. If you build a very good model for example using transfer learning you should be able to achieve 98%+ on test set accuracy. If you find this data set useful please upvote. Thanks Collection of sports images covering 100 different sports.. Images are 224 224 3 jpg format. Data is separated into train  test and valid directories.  Additionallly a csv file is included for those that wish to use it to create there own train  test and validation datasets.. Wanted to build a high quality clean data set that was easy to use and had no bad images or duplication between the train  test and validation data sets. Provides a good data set to test your models on. Design for  straight forward application of keras preprocessing functions like ImageDataenerator.flow_from_directory or if you use the csv file ImageDataGenerator.flow_from_dataframe. This dataset was carefully created so that the region of interest (ROI) in this case the sport occupies approximately 50% of the pixels in the image. As a consequence even models of moderate complexity should achieve training and validation accuracies in the high 90's.

How would you describe this dataset? Metadata Collaborators Authors Coverage DOI Citation Provenance License Expected Update Frequency Activity Overview Views Downloads Engagement Comments Top Contributors Detail View Related Notebooks Similar Datasets,Customer churn refers to the phenomenon where customers discontinue their relationship or subscription with a company or service provider. It represents the rate at which customers stop using a company's products or services within a specific period. Churn is an important metric for businesses as it directly impacts revenue  growth  and customer retention. In the context of the Churn dataset  the churn label indicates whether a customer has churned or not. A churned customer is one who has decided to discontinue their subscription or usage of the company's services. On the other hand  a non-churned customer is one who continues to remain engaged and retains their relationship with the company. Understanding customer churn is crucial for businesses to identify patterns  factors  and indicators that contribute to customer attrition. By analyzing churn behavior and its associated features  companies can develop strategies to retain existing customers  improve customer satisfaction  and reduce customer turnover. Predictive modeling techniques can also be applied to forecast and proactively address potential churn  enabling companies to take proactive measures to retain at-risk customers.

The dataset contains a unique ID for each patient  the type of cancer (diagnosis)  the visual characteristics of the cancer and the average values of these characteristics. There are also several categorical features where patients in the dataset are labeled with numerical values. You can examine them in the Chart area. Other features contain specific ranges of average values of the features of the cancer image: Each of these features is mapped to a table containing the number of values in a given range.You can examine the Chart Tables Each sample contains the patient's unique ID  the cancer diagnosis and the average values of the cancer's visual characteristics. Such a dataset can be used to train or test models and algorithms used to make cancer diagnoses. Understanding and analyzing the dataset can contribute to the improvement of cancer-related visual features and diagnosis. Logistic Regression:This algorithm can be used effectively for binary classification problems. In this dataset  logistic regression may be an appropriate choice since there are ""Malignant"" (benign) and ""Benign"" (malignant) classes. It can be used to predict cancer type with the visual features in the dataset. K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN):KNN classifies an example by looking at the k closest examples around it. This algorithm assumes that patients with similar characteristics tend to have similar types of cancer. KNN can be used for cancer diagnosis by taking into account neighborhood relationships in the data set. Support Vector Machines (SVM):SVM is effective for classification tasks  especially for two-class problems. Focusing on the clear separation of classes in the dataset  SVM is a powerful algorithm that can be used for cancer diagnosis.

Metadata Collaborators Authors Coverage DOI Citation Provenance License Expected Update Frequency Activity Overview Views Downloads Engagement Comments Top Contributors Detail View Related Notebooks Similar Datasets,"Affect recognition aims to detect a person's affective state based on observables  with the goal to e.g. improve human-computer interaction. Long-term stress is known to have severe implications on wellbeing  which call for continuous and automated stress monitoring systems. However  the affective computing community lacks commonly used standard datasets for wearable stress detection which a) provide multimodal high-quality data  and b) include multiple affective states. Therefore  we introduce WESAD  a new publicly available dataset for wearable stress and affect detection. This multimodal dataset features physiological and motion data  recorded from both a wrist- and a chest-worn device  of 15 subjects during a lab study. The following sensor modalities are included: blood volume pulse  electrocardiogram  electrodermal activity  electromyogram  respiration  body temperature  and three-axis acceleration. Moreover  the dataset bridges the gap between previous lab studies on stress and emotions  by containing three different affective states (neutral  stress  amusement). In addition  self-reports of the subjects  which were obtained using several established questionnaires  are contained in the dataset. Furthermore  a benchmark is created on the dataset  using well-known features and standard machine learning methods. Considering the three-class classification problem (baseline vs. stress vs. amusement)  we achieved classification accuracies of up to 80%. In the binary case (stress vs. non-stress)  accuracies of up to 93% were reached. Finally  we provide a detailed analysis and comparison of the two device locations (chest vs. wrist) as well as the different sensor modalities.

Credit score cards are a common risk control method in the financial industry. It uses personal information and data submitted by credit card applicants to predict the probability of future defaults and credit card borrowings. The bank is able to decide whether to issue a credit card to the applicant. Credit scores can objectively quantify the magnitude of risk.Generally speaking  credit score cards are based on historical data. Once encountering large economic fluctuations. Past models may lose their original predictive power. Logistic model is a common method for credit scoring. Because Logistic is suitable for binary classification tasks and can calculate the coefficients of each feature. In order to facilitate understanding and operation  the score card will multiply the logistic regression coefficient by a certain value (such as 100) and round it.At present  with the development of machine learning algorithms. More predictive methods such as Boosting  Random Forest  and Support Vector Machines have been introduced into credit card scoring. However  these methods often do not have good transparency. It may be difficult to provide customers and regulators with a reason for rejection or acceptance. Build a machine learning model to predict if an applicant is 'good' or 'bad' client  different from other tasks  the definition of 'good' or 'bad' is not given.

Certain chats use conventional terminology  while others utilize colloquial expressions. Slang phrases emerged because younger gamers often incorporate them into their regular conversations. The author personally categorizes the chats under four classifications: neutral  violent  racist  and harassing. Classification details:Neutral: no violent sentences  casual chat without any means to harm someoneViolence: swearing sentences  threats  incitement to harm others  or associating people with some animal or creatureRacist: discriminate against or demean people based on race  religion  ethnicity  or nationality  including slurs  hate speech  or promoting racial superiorityHarassment: porn  sexual abuse words  body shaming  derogation An example of the dataset's content and the preprocessing methodology is the sentence: ‚ÄúPada bisa diem ga sih  4nj1n9 semua ‚Äù which translates to ‚ÄúCan you shut up  all of you are dogs ‚Äù where numbers substitute certain letters in the word 'dog ' categorized as 'violence.' The preprocessing procedure involves converting the phrase to lowercase  normalizing it by eliminating punctuation  and substituting some numerals with their nearest alphabetic equivalents  for as replacing the numeral 4 with 'a' and 1 with 'i'.

What's interesting is that this dataset is the sheer variety of data which helps train a model that can be generalised across new datasets. Many audio datasets use a limited number of speakers which leads to a lot of information leakage. CREMA-D has many speakers. For this fact  the CREMA-D is a very good dataset to use to ensure the model does not overfit. CREMA-D is a data set of 7 442 original clips from 91 actors. These clips were from 48 male and 43 female actors between the ages of 20 and 74 coming from a variety of races and ethnicities (African America  Asian  Caucasian  Hispanic  and Unspecified). Actors spoke from a selection of 12 sentences. The sentences were presented using one of six different emotions (Anger  Disgust  Fear  Happy  Neutral  and Sad) and four different emotion levels (Low  Medium  High  and Unspecified).

It spans more than 15 years and covers two regions in Central Europe (Southwest Bohemia and the Western Carpathians) and contains around 37k manually verified and labeled images. Detailed statistics on image counts  identity coverage  and geographic distribution are listed below. All images are in JPEG format  with metadata provided in structured CSV files. The metadata includes individual identity labels  observation timestamps  and camera-trap locations. The folder structure is source-specific  with separate directories for real and synthetic data  further divided by source (e.g. beskydy/ nps/ sumava/) and corresponding annotations. To allow standardized development and evaluation for various use-cases  we provide multiple sub-datasets and appropriate training/validation/test splits. Additional metadata are provided for most images in the CzechLynx dataset  covering data origin  temporal context (e.g.  observation date  relative age since first sighting  encounter sequence)  spatial context (10 √ó 10 km grid-cell code  location and trap identifiers  GPS coordinates)  phenotypic annotation  and dataset-split flags (geo-aware  time-open  and time-closed). These annotations support flexible filtering and grouping for reproducible  domain-aware evaluation of re-identification  pose estimation  and segmentation models. The CzechLynx dataset is organized into three subsets tailored for: (i)Individual re-identification  (ii)Animal pose estimation  and (iii)Instance segmentation. Each subset largely overlaps but differs by inclusion criteria and annotation detail. Note:Due to the risk of revealing exact animal locations from background details  only the re-identification subset with cropped animals is publicly available. The pose estimation and instance segmentation subsets are available upon request under an NDA withFriends of the Earth  Czech Republic. To support robust evaluation under real-world constraints  CzechLynx provides three distinct splits:

AbstractRice  which is among the most widely produced grain products worldwide  has many genetic varieties. These varieties are separated from each other due to some of their features. These are usually features such as texture  shape  and color. With these features that distinguish rice varieties  it is possible to classify and evaluate the quality of seeds. In this study  Arborio  Basmati  Ipsala  Jasmine and Karacadag  which are five different varieties of rice often grown in Turkey  were used. A total of 75 000 grain images  15 000 from each of these varieties  are included in the dataset. A second dataset with 106 features including 12 morphological  4 shape and 90 color features obtained from these images was used. Models were created by using Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and Deep Neural Network (DNN) algorithms for the feature dataset and by using the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) algorithm for the image dataset  and classification processes were performed. Statistical results of sensitivity  specificity  prediction  F1 score  accuracy  false positive rate and false negative rate were calculated using the confusion matrix values of the models and the results of each model were given in tables. Classification successes from the models were achieved as 99.87% for ANN  99.95% for DNN and 100% for CNN. With the results  it is seen that the models used in the study in the classification of rice varieties can be applied successfully in this field.

The training folder contains 300 images with annotations. The testing and validation folder both contain 60 images with annotations. We have done some modification over the original dataset to prepare this CBC dataset where some of the image annotation files contain very low red blood cells (RBCs) than actual and one annotation file does not include any RBC at all although the cell smear image contains RBCs. So  we clear up all the fallacious files and split the dataset into three parts. Among the 360 smear images  300 blood cell images with annotations are used as the training set first  and then the rest of the 60 images with annotations are used as the testing set. Due to the shortage of the data  a subset of the training set is used to prepare the validation set which contains 60 images with annotations.

If the company does not know about these seasons  it can lose too much money. Predicting future sales is one of the most crucial plans for a company. Sales forecasting gives an idea to the company for arranging stocks  calculating revenue  and deciding to make a new investment. Another advantage of knowing future sales is that achieving predetermined targets from the beginning of the seasons can have a positive effect on stock prices and investors' perceptions. Also  not reaching the projected target could significantly damage stock prices  conversely. And  it will be a big problem especially for Walmart as a big company. My aim in this project is to build a model which predicts sales of the stores. With this model  Walmart authorities can decide their future plans which is very important for arranging stocks  calculating revenue and deciding to make new investment or not.

Weight of the error changes when it is holiday. Understanding  Cleaning and Exploring Data:The first challange of this data is that there are too much seasonal effects on sales. Some departments have higher sales in some seasons but on average the best departments are different. To analyze these effects  data divided weeks of the year and also holiday dates categorized. Preparing Data to Modeling:Boolean and string features encoded and whole columns encoded. Random Forest Regressor:Feature selection was done according to feature importance and as a best result 1801 error found. ARIMA/ExponentialSmooting/ARCH Models:Second challange in this data is that it is not stationary. To make data more stationary taking difference log and shift techniques applied. The least error was found with ExponentialSmooting as 821. More detailed finding can be found in notebooks with explorations. Data will be made more stationary with different techniques. More detailed feature engineering and feature selection will be done. More data can be found to observe holiday effects on sales and different holidays will be added like Easter  Halloween and  Come Back to School times. Markdown effects on model will be improved according to department sales. Different models can be build for special stores or departments. Market basket analysis can be done to find higher demand items of departments.

The vegetables that are chosen for the experimentation are- bean  bitter gourd  bottle gourd  brinjal  broccoli  cabbage  capsicum  carrot  cauliflower  cucumber  papaya  potato  pumpkin  radish and tomato. A total of 21000 images from 15 classes are used where each class contains 1400 images of size 224√ó224 and in *.jpg format. The dataset split 70% for training  15% for validation  and 15% for testing purpose. This dataset contains three folders: The images in this dataset were collected by us from  vegetable farm and market for a project. We would like to give thanks to the people who helped us regarding data collection. From vegetable production to delivery  several common steps are operated manually. Like picking  and sorting vegetables. Therefore  we decided to solve this problem using deep neural architecture  by developing a model that can detect and classify vegetables. That model can be implemented in different types of devices and can also solve other problems related to the identification of vegetables  like labeling the vegetables automatically without any need for human work.

Specifically  for Task 1 the datasets used in this year's challenge have been updated  since BraTS'20  with many more routine clinically-acquired mpMRI scans. Ground truth annotations of the tumor sub-regions are created and approved by expert neuroradiologists for every subject included in the training  validation  and testing datasets to quantitatively evaluate the predicted tumor segmentations. All BraTS mpMRI scans are available as NIfTI files (.nii.gz) and describe a) native (T1) and b) post-contrast T1-weighted (T1Gd)  c) T2-weighted (T2)  and d) T2 Fluid Attenuated Inversion Recovery (T2-FLAIR) volumes  and were acquired with different clinical protocols and various scanners from multiple data contributing institutions. We intend to release the associated de-identifed DICOM (.dcm) files after the conclusion of the challenge. All the imaging datasets have been annotated manually  by one to four raters  following the same annotation protocol  and their annotations were approved by experienced neuro-radiologists. Annotations comprise the GD-enhancing tumor (ET ‚Äî label 4)  the peritumoral edematous/invaded tissue (ED ‚Äî label 2)  and the necrotic tumor core (NCR ‚Äî label 1)  as described both in the BraTS 2012-2013 TMI paper and in the latest BraTS summarizing paper. The ground truth data were created after their pre-processing  i.e.  co-registered to the same anatomical template  interpolated to the same resolution (1 mm3) and skull-stripped. This year we provide the naming convention and name mapping between the data of BraTS'21-'17  and the subjects used from the data collections of TCGA-GBM  TCGA-LGG  IvyGAP  and CPTAC-GBM  available through The Cancer Imaging Archive (TCIA) to further facilitate research beyond the directly BraTS related tasks.

The resolution was kept to the original dataset. NB:The image data for this collection is structured such that each participant has multiple patient IDs.  For example  pat_id 00038 has 10 separate patient IDs which provide information about the scans within the IDs (e.g. Calc-Test_P_00038_LEFT_CC  Calc-Test_P_00038_RIGHT_CC_1)  This makes it appear as though there are 6 671 participants according to the DICOM metadata  but there are only 1 566 actual participants in the cohort. ThisCBIS-DDSM (Curated Breast Imaging Subset of DDSM)is an updated and standardized version of theDigital Database for Screening Mammography (DDSM).  The DDSM is a database of2 620scanned film mammography studies. It containsnormal benign  andmalignantcases with verified pathology information. The scale of the database along with ground truth validation makes the DDSM a useful tool in the development and testing of decision support systems. TheCBIS-DDSMcollection includes a subset of theDDDSMdata selected and curated by a trained mammographer.  The images have been decompressed and converted toDICOMformat.  Updated ROI segmentation and bounding boxes  and pathologic diagnosis for training data are also included.  A manuscript describing how to use this dataset in detail is available athttps://www.nature.com/articles/sdata2017177. Published research results from work in developing decision support systems in mammography are difficult to replicate due to the lack of a standard evaluation data set; most computer-aided diagnosis (CADx) and detection (CADe) algorithms for breast cancer in mammography are evaluated on private data sets or on unspecified subsets of public databases. Few well-curated public datasets have been provided for the mammography community. These include the DDSM  the Mammographic Imaging Analysis Society (MIAS) database  and the Image Retrieval in Medical Applications (IRMA) project. Although these public data sets are useful  they are limited in terms of data set size and accessibility. For example  most researchers using the DDSM do not leverage all its images for a variety of historical reasons. When the database was released in 1997  computational resources to process hundreds or thousands of images were not widely available. Additionally  the DDSM images are saved in non-standard compression files that require the use of decompression code that has not been updated or maintained for modern computers. Finally  the ROI annotations for the abnormalities in the DDSM were provided to indicate a general position of lesions  but not a precise segmentation for them. Therefore  many researchers must implement segmentation algorithms for accurate feature extraction. This causes an inability to directly compare the performance of methods or to replicate prior results. The CBIS-DDSM collection addresses that challenge by publicly releasing a curated and standardized version of the DDSM for evaluation of future CADx and CADe systems (sometimes referred to generally as CAD) research in mammography. Please note that the image data for this collection is structured such that each participant has multiple patient IDs.  For example  participant 00038 has 10 separate patient IDs which provide information about the scans within the IDs (e.g. Calc-Test_P_00038_LEFT_CC  Calc-Test_P_00038_RIGHT_CC_1).

Hiring the right talent is a challenge for all businesses. This challenge is magnified by the high volume of applicants if the business is labour-intensive  growing  and facing high attrition rates. IT departments are short of growing markets. In a typical service organization  professionals with a variety of technical skills and business domain expertise are hired and assigned to projects to resolve customer issues. This task of selecting the best talent among many others is known as Resume Screening. Typically  large companies do not have enough time to open each CV  so they use machine learning algorithms for the Resume Screening task.

So I wanted to understand more about it andthis posthelped me get started. Once the basics are done  the data scientist inside me started raising questions like: So what next?Now that we have the price data  I wanted to dig a little more about the factors affecting the price of coins. I started of with Bitcoin and there are quite a few parameters which affect the price of Bitcoin. Thanks toBlockchain Info  I was able to get quite a few parameters on once in two day basis. This will help understand the other factors related to Bitcoin price and also help one make future predictions in a better way than just using the historical price. The dataset has one csv file for each currency. Price history is available on a daily basis from April 28  2013.  This dataset has the historical price information of some of the top crypto currencies by market capitalization. This data is taken fromcoinmarketcapand it isfreeto use the data. Cover Image : Photo by Thomas Malama on Unsplash Some of the questions which could be inferred from this dataset are: How did the historical prices / market capitalizations of various currencies change over time?

Garbage Recycling is a key aspect of preserving our environment. To make the recycling process possible/easier  the garbage must be sorted to groups that have similar recycling process. I found that most available data sets classify garbage into a few classes (2 to 6 classes at most). Having the ability to sort the household garbage into more classes can result in dramatically increasing the percentage of the recycled garbage. An ideal setting for data collection would be to place a camera above a conveyor where the garbage comes one by one  so that the camera can capture real garbage images. But since such a setup is not feasible at the moment I  collected most of the images in this dataset by web scraping  I tried to get images close to garbage images whenever possible  for example in biological garbage category I searched for rotten vegetables  rotten fruits and food remains  etc.  However  for some classes such as clothes or shoes it was more difficult to get images of clothes or shoes from the garbage  so mostly it was images of normal clothes. Nevertheless  being able to classify the images of this data set to 12 classes can be a big step towards improving the recycling process.

Our own estimate based on UN data shows the world's population surpassing 7.7 billion. China is the most populous country in the world with a population exceeding 1.4 billion. It is one of just two countries with a population of more than 1 billion  with India being the second. As of 2018  India has a population of over 1.355 billion people  and its population growth is expected to continue through at least 2050. By the year 2030  the country of India is expected to become the most populous country in the world. This is because India‚Äôs population will grow  while China is projected to see a loss in population. The following 11 countries that are the most populous in the world each have populations exceeding 100 million. These include the United States  Indonesia  Brazil  Pakistan  Nigeria  Bangladesh  Russia  Mexico  Japan  Ethiopia  and the Philippines. Of these nations  all are expected to continue to grow except Russia and Japan  which will see their populations drop by 2030 before falling again significantly by 2050. Many other nations have populations of at least one million  while there are also countries that have just thousands. The smallest population in the world can be found in Vatican City  where only 801 people reside. In 2018  the world‚Äôs population growth rate was 1.12%. Every five years since the 1970s  the population growth rate has continued to fall. The world‚Äôs population is expected to continue to grow larger but at a much slower pace. By 2030  the population will exceed 8 billion. In 2040  this number will grow to more than 9 billion. In 2055  the number will rise to over 10 billion  and another billion people won‚Äôt be added until near the end of the century. The current annual population growth estimates from the United Nations are in the millions - estimating that over 80 million new lives are added each year. This population growth will be significantly impacted by nine specific countries which are situated to contribute to the population growing more quickly than other nations. These nations include the Democratic Republic of the Congo  Ethiopia  India  Indonesia  Nigeria  Pakistan  Uganda  the United Republic of Tanzania  and the United States of America. Particularly of interest  India is on track to overtake China's position as the most populous country by 2030. Additionally  multiple nations within Africa are expected to double their populations before fertility rates begin to slow entirely. In this Dataset  we have Historical Population data for every Country/Territory in the world by different parameters like Area Size of the Country/Territory  Name of the Continent  Name of the Capital  Density  Population Growth Rate  Ranking based on Population  World Population Percentage  etc. This Dataset is created fromhttps://worldpopulationreview.com/.

Metadata Collaborators Authors Coverage DOI Citation Provenance License Expected Update Frequency Activity Overview Views Downloads Engagement Comments Top Contributors Detail View Related Notebooks Similar Datasets,LOGISTIC REGRESSION - HEART DISEASE PREDICTION IntroductionWorld Health Organization has estimated 12 million deaths occur worldwide  every year due to Heart diseases. Half the deaths in the United States and other developed countries are due to cardio vascular diseases. The early prognosis of cardiovascular diseases can aid in making decisions on lifestyle changes in high risk patients and in turn reduce the complications. This research intends to pinpoint the most relevant/risk factors of heart disease as well as predict the overall risk using logistic regressionData Preparation SourceThe dataset is publically available on the Kaggle website  and it is from an ongoing cardiovascular study on residents of the town of Framingham  Massachusetts. The classification goal is to predict whether the patient has 10-year risk of future coronary heart disease (CHD).The dataset provides the patients‚Äô information. It includes over 4 000 records and 15 attributes.VariablesEach attribute is a potential risk factor. There are both demographic  behavioral and medical risk factors. Demographic:‚Ä¢    Sex: male or female(Nominal)‚Ä¢    Age: Age of the patient;(Continuous - Although the recorded ages have been truncated to whole numbers  the concept of age is continuous)Behavioral‚Ä¢    Current Smoker: whether or not the patient is a current smoker (Nominal)‚Ä¢    Cigs Per Day: the number of cigarettes that the person smoked on average in one day.(can be considered continuous as one can have any number of cigarettes  even half a cigarette.)Medical( history)‚Ä¢    BP Meds: whether or not the patient was on blood pressure medication (Nominal)‚Ä¢    Prevalent Stroke: whether or not the patient had previously had a stroke (Nominal)‚Ä¢    Prevalent Hyp: whether or not the patient was hypertensive (Nominal)‚Ä¢    Diabetes: whether or not the patient had diabetes (Nominal)Medical(current)‚Ä¢    Tot Chol: total cholesterol level (Continuous)‚Ä¢    Sys BP: systolic blood pressure (Continuous)‚Ä¢    Dia BP: diastolic blood pressure (Continuous)‚Ä¢    BMI: Body Mass Index (Continuous)‚Ä¢    Heart Rate: heart rate (Continuous - In medical research  variables such as heart rate though in fact discrete  yet are considered continuous because of large number of possible values.)‚Ä¢    Glucose: glucose level (Continuous)Predict variable (desired target)‚Ä¢    10 year risk of coronary heart disease CHD (binary: ‚Äú1‚Äù  means ‚ÄúYes‚Äù  ‚Äú0‚Äù means ‚ÄúNo‚Äù)Logistic RegressionLogistic regression is a type of regression analysis in statistics used for prediction of outcome of a categorical dependent variable from a set of predictor or independent variables. In logistic regression the dependent variable is always binary. Logistic regression is mainly used to for prediction and also calculating the probability of success.The results above show some of the attributes with P value higher than the preferred alpha(5%) and thereby showing low statistically significant relationship with the probability of heart disease. Backward elimination approach is used here to remove those attributes with highest P-value one at a time followed by running the regression repeatedly until all attributes have P Values less than 0.05.Feature Selection: Backward elimination (P-value approach)Logistic regression equationP=eŒ≤0+Œ≤1X1/1+eŒ≤0+Œ≤1X1P=eŒ≤0+Œ≤1X1/1+eŒ≤0+Œ≤1X1When all features plugged in:logit(p)=log(p/(1‚àíp))=Œ≤0+Œ≤1‚àóSexmale+Œ≤2‚àóage+Œ≤3‚àócigsPerDay+Œ≤4‚àótotChol+Œ≤5‚àósysBP+Œ≤6‚àóglucoselogit(p)=log(p/(1‚àíp))=Œ≤0+Œ≤1‚àóSexmale+Œ≤2‚àóage+Œ≤3‚àócigsPerDay+Œ≤4‚àótotChol+Œ≤5‚àósysBP+Œ≤6‚àóglucose Interpreting the results: Odds Ratio  Confidence Intervals and P-values‚Ä¢    This fitted model shows that  holding all other features constant  the odds of getting diagnosed with heart disease for males (sex_male = 1)over that of females (sex_male = 0) is exp(0.5815) = 1.788687. In terms of percent change  we can say that the odds for males are 78.8% higher than the odds for females.‚Ä¢    The coefficient for age says that  holding all others constant  we will see 7% increase in the odds of getting diagnosed with CDH for a one year increase in age since exp(0.0655) = 1.067644.‚Ä¢    Similarly   with every extra cigarette one smokes thers is a 2% increase in the odds of CDH.‚Ä¢    For Total cholesterol level and glucose level there is no significant change. ‚Ä¢    There is a 1.7% increase in odds for every unit increase in systolic Blood Pressure. Model Evaluation - StatisticsFrom the above statistics it is clear that the model is highly specific than sensitive. The negative values are predicted more accurately than the positives.Predicted probabilities of 0 (No Coronary Heart Disease) and 1 ( Coronary Heart Disease: Yes) for the test data with a default classification threshold of 0.5lower the thresholdSince the model is predicting Heart disease too many type II errors is not advisable. A False Negative ( ignoring the probability of disease when there actually is one) is more dangerous than a False Positive in this case. Hence in order to increase the sensitivity  threshold can be lowered. Conclusions‚Ä¢    All attributes selected after the elimination process show P-values lower than 5% and thereby suggesting significant role in the Heart disease prediction. ‚Ä¢    Men seem to be more susceptible to heart disease than women. Increase in age  number of cigarettes smoked per day and systolic Blood Pressure also show increasing odds of having heart disease ‚Ä¢    Total cholesterol shows no significant change in the odds of CHD. This could be due to the presence of 'good cholesterol(HDL) in the total cholesterol reading. Glucose too causes a very negligible change in odds (0.2%) ‚Ä¢    The model predicted with 0.88 accuracy. The model is more specific than sensitive. Overall model could be improved with more data Appendixhttp://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs317/en/Data Source Referenceshttps://www.kaggle.com/amanajmera1/framingham-heart-study-dataset/data

How would you describe this dataset? Metadata Collaborators Authors Coverage DOI Citation Provenance License Expected Update Frequency Activity Overview Views Downloads Engagement Comments Top Contributors Detail View,Relevant links: AbstractMany intellectual endeavors require mathematical problem solving  but this skill remains beyond the capabilities of computers. To measure this ability in machine learning models  we introduce MATH  a new dataset of 12 500 challenging competition mathematics problems. Each problem in MATH has a full step-by-step solution which can be used to teach models to generate answer derivations and explanations. To facilitate future research and increase accuracy on MATH  we also contribute a large auxiliary pretraining dataset which helps teach models the fundamentals of mathematics. Even though we are able to increase accuracy on MATH  our results show that accuracy remains relatively low  even with enormous Transformer models. Moreover  we find that simply increasing budgets and model parameter counts will be impractical for achieving strong mathematical reasoning if scaling trends continue. While scaling Transformers is automatically solving most other text-based tasks  scaling is not currently solving MATH. To have more traction on mathematical problem solving we will likely need new algorithmic advancements from the broader research community.

Metadata Collaborators Authors Coverage DOI Citation Provenance License Expected Update Frequency Activity Overview Views Downloads Engagement Comments Top Contributors Detail View Related Notebooks Similar Datasets,"BraTS has always been focusing on the evaluation of state-of-the-art methods for the segmentation of brain tumors in multimodal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans. BraTS 2020 utilizes multi-institutional pre-operative MRI scans and primarily focuses on the segmentation (Task 1) of intrinsically heterogeneous (in appearance  shape  and histology) brain tumors  namely gliomas. Furthemore  to pinpoint the clinical relevance of this segmentation task  BraTS‚Äô20 also focuses on the prediction of patient overall survival (Task 2)  and the distinction between pseudoprogression and true tumor recurrence (Task 3)  via integrative analyses of radiomic features and machine learning algorithms. Finally  BraTS'20 intends to evaluate the algorithmic uncertainty in tumor segmentation (Task 4). In this year's challenge  4 reference standards are used for the 4 tasks of the challenge: All BraTS multimodal scans are available as NIfTI files (.nii.gz) and describe a) native (T1) and b) post-contrast T1-weighted (T1Gd)  c) T2-weighted (T2)  and d) T2 Fluid Attenuated Inversion Recovery (T2-FLAIR) volumes  and were acquired with different clinical protocols and various scanners from multiple (n=19) institutions  mentioned as data contributors here. All the imaging datasets have been segmented manually  by one to four raters  following the same annotation protocol  and their annotations were approved by experienced neuro-radiologists. Annotations comprise the GD-enhancing tumor (ET ‚Äî label 4)  the peritumoral edema (ED ‚Äî label 2)  and the necrotic and non-enhancing tumor core (NCR/NET ‚Äî label 1)  as described both in the BraTS 2012-2013 TMI paper and in the latest BraTS summarizing paper. The provided data are distributed after their pre-processing  i.e.  co-registered to the same anatomical template  interpolated to the same resolution (1 mm^3) and skull-stripped. All the slices of volumes have been converted to hdf5 format for saving memory. Metadata contains volume_no  slice_no   and target of that slice. Participants are allowed to use additional public and/or private data (from their own institutions) for data augmentation  only if they also report results using only the BraTS'20 data and discuss any potential difference in their papers and results.

The majority of lung cancer cases are attributed to smoking  but exposure to air pollution is also a risk factor. A new study has found that air pollution may be linked to an increased risk of lung cancer  even in nonsmokers. The study  which was published in the journal Nature Medicine  looked at data from over 462 000 people in China who were followed for an average of six years. The participants were divided into two groups: those who lived in areas with high levels of air pollution and those who lived in areas with low levels of air pollution. The researchers found that the people in the high-pollution group were more likely to develop lung cancer than those in the low-pollution group. They also found that the risk was higher in nonsmokers than smokers  and that the risk increased with age. While this study does not prove that air pollution causes lung cancer  it does suggest that there may be a link between the two. More research is needed to confirm these findings and to determine what effect different types and levels of air pollution may have on lung cancer risk See the dataset description for more information.

Reduction of child mortality is reflected in several of the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals and is a key indicator of human progress.The UN expects that by 2030  countries end preventable deaths of newborns and children under 5 years of age  with all countries aiming to reduce under‚Äë5 mortality to at least as low as 25 per 1 000 live births. Parallel to notion of child mortality is of course maternal mortality  which accounts for295 000 deathsduring and following pregnancy and childbirth (as of 2017). The vast majority of these deaths(94%)occurred in low-resource settings  and mostcould have been prevented. In light of what was mentioned above Cardiotocograms (CTGs)are a simple and cost accessible option to assess fetal health  allowing healthcare professionals to take action in order to prevent child and maternal mortality. The equipment itself works by sending ultrasound pulses and reading its response  thus shedding light on fetal heart rate (FHR)  fetal movements  uterine contractions and more. This dataset contains2126records of features extracted from Cardiotocogram exams  which were then classified by three expert obstetritians into3 classes: If you use this dataset in your research  please credit the authors.

Since the course has been ARCHIVED - which means the discussion posts are not answered!! - hence my posting of the problem here. What better way to learn than to get so many experts giving me feedback ‚Ä¶ right? # Content The data was taken over a 2-month period in India with 25 features ( eg  red blood cell count  white blood cell count  etc). The target is the 'classification'  which is either 'ckd' or 'notckd' -ckd=chronic kidney disease. There are 400 rows The data needs cleaning: in that it has NaNs and the numeric features need to be forced to floats. Basically  we were instructed to get rid of ALL ROWS with Nans  with no threshold - meaning  any row that has even one NaN  gets deleted. Part 1: We are asked to choose 3 features(bgr  rc  wc)  visualize them  then run the PCA with n_components=2.the PCA is to berun twice: one withno scalingand the second run WITH scaling. And this is where my issue starts ‚Ä¶in that after scaling I can hardly see any difference! I will stop here for now till I get feedback and then move to Part 2. The dataset is available at:https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Chronic_Kidney_Disease I would like to get an intuitive and a practical understanding of PCA.

There are certain events and holidays which impact sales on each day. There are sales data available for 45 stores of Walmart. The business is facing a challenge due to unforeseen demands and runs out of stock some times  due to the inappropriate machine learning algorithm. An ideal ML algorithm will predict demand accurately and ingest factors like economic conditions including CPI  Unemployment Index  etc. Walmart runs several promotional markdown events throughout the year. These markdowns precede prominent holidays  the four largest of all  which are the Super Bowl  Labour Day  Thanksgiving  and Christmas. The weeks including these holidays are weighted five times higher in the evaluation than non-holiday weeks. Part of the challenge presented by this competition is modeling the effects of markdowns on these holiday weeks in the absence of complete/ideal historical data. Historical sales data for 45 Walmart stores located in different regions are available. The dataset is taken from Kaggle.

Data was collected to train a model to distinguish between the images that contain fire (fire images) and regular images (non-fire images)  so the whole problem wasbinary classification. Data is divided into 2 folders fire_imagesfolder contains 755 outdoor-fire images some of them contains heavy smoke  the other one isnon-fire_imageswhich contain 244 nature images (eg: forest  tree  grass  river  people  foggy forest  lake  animal  road  and waterfall). Hint: Data is skewed  which means  the 2 classes(folders) doesn't have an equal number of samples  so make sure that you have a validation set with an equally-sized number of images per class (eg: 40 images of both fire and non-fire classes).

It includes demographic data  social-economic factors and academic performance information that can be used to analyze the possible predictors of student dropout and academic success. This dataset contains multiple disjoint databases consisting of relevant information available at the time of enrollment  such as application mode  marital status  course chosen and more. Additionally  this data can be used to estimate overall student performance at the end of each semester by assessing curricular units credited/enrolled/evaluated/approved as well as their respective grades. Finally  we have unemployment rate  inflation rate and GDP from the region which can help us further understand how economic factors play into student dropout rates or academic success outcomes. This powerful analysis tool will provide valuable insight into what motivates students to stay in school or abandon their studies for a wide range of disciplines such as agronomy  design  education nursing journalism management social service or technologies For more datasets  clickhere. This dataset can be used to understand and predict student dropouts and academic outcomes. The data includes a variety of demographic  social-economic and academic performance factors related to the students enrolled in higher education institutions. The dataset provides valuable insights into the factors that affect student success and could be used to guide interventions and policies related to student retention. Using this dataset  researchers can investigate two key questions: In order to use this dataset effectively it is important that scientists familiarize themselves with all variables provided in the dataset including categorical (qualitative) variables such as gender or application mode; numerical variables such as number of curricular units at the beginning of semesters or age at enrollment; ordinal data measurement type variables such as marital status; studied trends over time such as inflation rate or GDP; frequency measurements variables like percentage of scholarship holders; etc.. Additionally scientists should make sure they aware off all potential bias included in the data prior running analysis‚Äìfor example understanding if one population is underrepresented compared another -as this phenomenon could lead unexpected results if not taken into consideration while conducting research undertaken using this data set.. Finally it would be important for practitioners realize that this current Kaggle Dataset contains only one semester-worth information on each admission intake whereas additional studies conducted for a longer time period might be able provide more accurate results related selected topic area due further deterioration retention achievement coefficients obtained from those gradually accurate experiments unfolding different year-long admissions seasons If you use this dataset in your research  please credit the original authors.Data Source License:CC0 1.0 Universal (CC0 1.0) - Public Domain DedicationNo Copyright - You can copy  modify  distribute and perform the work  even for commercial purposes  all without asking permission.See Other Information.

This data set is the Kaggle version of the very well known public data set for asset degradation modeling from NASA. It includes Run-to-Failure simulated data from turbo fan jet engines. Engine degradation simulation was carried out using C-MAPSS. Four different were sets simulated under different combinations of operational conditions and fault modes. Records several sensor channels to characterize fault evolution. The data set was provided by the Prognostics CoE at NASA Ames. In this dataset the goal is to predict the remaining useful life (RUL) of each engine in the test dataset. RUL is equivalent of number of flights remained for the engine after the last datapoint in the test dataset. Data sets consists of multiple multivariate time series. Each data set is further divided into training and test subsets. Each time series is from a different engine i.e.  the data can be considered to be from a fleet of engines of the same type. Each engine starts with different degrees of initial wear and manufacturing variation which is unknown to the user. This wear and variation is considered normal  i.e.  it is not considered a fault condition. There are three operational settings that have a substantial effect on engine performance. These settings are also included in the data. The data is contaminated with sensor noise. The engine is operating normally at the start of each time series  and develops a fault at some point during the series. In the training set  the fault grows in magnitude until system failure. In the test set  the time series ends some time prior to system failure. The objective of the competition is to predict the number of remaining operational cycles before failure in the test set  i.e.  the number of operational cycles after the last cycle that the engine will continue to operate. Also provided a vector of true Remaining Useful Life (RUL) values for the test data. The data are provided as a zip-compressed text file with 26 columns of numbers  separated by spaces. Each row is a snapshot of data taken during a single operational cycle  each column is a different variable. The columns correspond to:1)    unit number2)    time  in cycles3)    operational setting 14)    operational setting 25)    operational setting 36)    sensor measurement  17)    sensor measurement  2‚Ä¶26)    sensor measurement  26 Data Set: FD001Train trjectories: 100Test trajectories: 100Conditions: ONE (Sea Level)Fault Modes: ONE (HPC Degradation) Data Set: FD002Train trjectories: 260Test trajectories: 259Conditions: SIXFault Modes: ONE (HPC Degradation) Data Set: FD003Train trjectories: 100Test trajectories: 100Conditions: ONE (Sea Level)Fault Modes: TWO (HPC Degradation  Fan Degradation) Data Set: FD004Train trjectories: 248Test trajectories: 249Conditions: SIXFault Modes: TWO (HPC Degradation  Fan Degradation) Reference: A.

How would you describe this dataset? Metadata Collaborators Authors Coverage DOI Citation Provenance License Expected Update Frequency Activity Overview Views Downloads Engagement Comments Top Contributors Detail View Related Notebooks Similar Datasets,I was always fascinated by the food culture of Bengaluru. Restaurants from all over the world can be found here in Bengaluru. From United States to Japan   Russia to Antarctica  you get all type of cuisines here.  Delivery  Dine-out  Pubs  Bars  Drinks Buffet  Desserts you name it and Bengaluru has it. Bengaluru  is best place for foodies. The number of restaurant are increasing day by day. Currently which stands at approximately 12 000 restaurants. With such an high number of restaurants. This industry hasn't been saturated yet. And new restaurants are opening every day. However it has become difficult for them to compete with already established restaurants.  The key issues that continue to pose a challenge to them include high real estate costs  rising food costs  shortage of quality manpower  fragmented supply chain and over-licensing.  This Zomato data aims at analysing demography of the location. Most importantly it will help new restaurants in deciding their theme  menus  cuisine  cost etc for a particular location. It also aims at finding similarity between neighborhoods of Bengaluru on the basis of food. The dataset also contains reviews for each of the restaurant which will help in finding overall rating for the place. The basic idea of analyzing the Zomato dataset is to get a fair idea about the factors affecting the establishmentof different types of restaurant at different places in Bengaluru  aggregate rating of each restaurant  Bengalurubeing one such city has more than 12 000 restaurants with restaurants serving dishes from all over the world.With each day new restaurants opening the industry has‚Äônt been saturated yet and the demand is increasingday by day. Inspite of increasing demand it however has become difficult for new restaurants to compete withestablished restaurants. Most of them serving the same food. Bengaluru being an IT capital of India. Most ofthe people here are dependent mainly on the restaurant food as they don‚Äôt have time to cook for themselves.With such an overwhelming demand of restaurants it has therefore become important to study the demographyof a location. What kind of a food is more popular in a locality. Do the entire locality loves vegetarian food.If yes then is that locality populated by a particular sect of people for eg. Jain  Marwaris  Gujaratis who aremostly vegetarian. These kind of analysis can be done using the data  by studying the factors such as‚Ä¢ Location of the restaurant‚Ä¢ Approx Price of food‚Ä¢ Theme based restaurant or not‚Ä¢ Which locality of that city serves that cuisines with maximum number of restaurants‚Ä¢ The needs of people who are striving to get the best cuisine of the neighborhood‚Ä¢ Is a particular neighborhood famous for its own kind of food. ‚ÄúJust so that you have a good meal the next time you step out‚Äù The data is accurate to that available on the zomato website until 15 March 2019.The data was scraped from Zomato in two phase. After going through the structure of the website I found that for each neighborhood there are 6-7 category of restaurants viz. Buffet  Cafes  Delivery  Desserts  Dine-out  Drinks & nightlife  Pubs and bars. Phase I  In Phase I of extraction only the URL  name and address of the restaurant were extracted which were visible on the front page. The URl's for each of the restaurants on the zomato were recorded in the csv file so that later the data can be extracted individually for each restaurant. This made the extraction process easier and reduced the extra load on my machine. The data for each neighborhood and each category can be foundhere Phase II  In Phase II the recorded data for each restaurant and each category was read and data for each restaurant was scraped individually. 15 variables were scraped in this phase. For each of the neighborhood and for each category their online_order  book_table  rate  votes  phone  location  rest_type  dish_liked  cuisines  approx_cost(for two people)  reviews_list  menu_item was extracted. See section 5 for more details about the variables. The data scraped was entirely for educational purposes only.  Note that I don‚Äôt claim any copyright for the data.  All copyrights for the data is owned by Zomato Media Pvt.  Ltd.. I was always astonished by how each of the restaurants are able to keep up the pace inspite of that cutting edge competition. And what factors should be kept in mind if someone wants to open new restaurant. Does the demography of an area matters? Does location of a  particular type of restaurant also depends on the people living in that area? Does the theme of the restaurant matters? Is a food chain category restaurant likely to have more customers than its counter part? Are any neighborhood similar ? If two neighborhood are similar does that mean these are related or particular group of people live in the neighborhood or these are the places to it? What kind of a food is more popular in a locality. Do the entire locality loves vegetarian food. If yes then is that locality populated by a particular sect of people for eg. Jain  Marwaris  Gujaratis who are mostly vegetarian. There are infacts dozens of question in my mind. lets try to find out the answer with this dataset.

To date  it contains 2 480  benign and 5 429 malignant samples (700X460 pixels  3-channel RGB  8-bit depth in each channel  PNG format). This database has been built in collaboration with the P&D Laboratory  ‚Äì Pathological Anatomy and Cytopathology  Parana  Brazil (http://www.prevencaoediagnose.com.br). We believe that researchers will find this database a useful tool since it makes future benchmarking and evaluation possible. The dataset BreaKHis is divided into two main groups: benign tumors and malignant tumors. Histologically benign is a term referring to a lesion that does not match any criteria of malignancy ‚Äì e.g.  marked cellular atypia  mitosis  disruption of basement membranes  metastasize  etc. Normally  benign tumors are relatively ‚Äúinnocents‚Äù  presents slow growing and remains localized. Malignant tumor is a synonym for cancer: lesion can invade and destroy adjacent structures (locally invasive) and spread to distant sites (metastasize) to cause death. In current version  samples present in dataset were collected by SOB method  also named partial mastectomy or excisional biopsy. This type of procedure  compared to any methods of needle biopsy  removes the larger size of tissue sample and is done in a hospital with general anesthetic. Both breast tumors benign and malignant can be sorted into different types based on the way the tumoral cells look under the microscope. Various types/subtypes of breast tumors can have different prognoses and treatment implications. The dataset currently contains four histological distinct types of benign breast tumors: adenosis (A)  fibroadenoma (F)  phyllodes tumor (PT)  and tubular adenona (TA);  and four malignant tumors (breast cancer): carcinoma (DC)  lobular carcinoma (LC)  mucinous carcinoma (MC) and papillary carcinoma (PC). Each image filename stores information about the image itself: method of procedure biopsy  tumor class  tumor type  patient identification  and magnification factor. For example  SOB_B_TA-14-4659-40-001.png is the image 1  at magnification factor 40X  of a benign tumor of type tubular adenoma  original from the slide 14-4659  which was collected by procedure SOB.

Metadata Collaborators Authors Coverage DOI Citation Provenance License Expected Update Frequency Activity Overview Views Downloads Engagement Comments Top Contributors Detail View Related Notebooks Similar Datasets,The dataset used is theOASIS MRI dataset(https://sites.wustl.edu/oasisbrains/)  which consists of 80 000 brain MRI images. The images have been divided into four classes based on Alzheimer's progression. The dataset aims to provide a valuable resource for analyzing and detecting early signs of Alzheimer's disease. To make the dataset accessible  the original .img and .hdr files were converted into Nifti format (.nii) using FSL (FMRIB Software Library). The converted MRI images of 461 patients have been uploaded to a GitHub repository  which can be accessed in multiple parts. For the neural network training  2D images were used as input. The brain images were sliced along the z-axis into 256 pieces  and slices ranging from 100 to 160 were selected from each patient. This approach resulted in a comprehensive dataset for analysis. Patient classification was performed based on the provided metadata and Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) values  resulting in four classes: demented  very mild demented  mild demented  and non-demented. These classes enable the detection and study of different stages of Alzheimer's disease progression. During the dataset preparation  the .nii MRI scans were converted to .jpg files. Although this conversion presented some challenges  the files were successfully processed using appropriate tools. The resulting dataset size is 1.3 GB. With this comprehensive dataset  the project aims to explore various neural network models and achieve optimal results in Alzheimer's disease detection and analysis.

In contrast to macronutrients ‚Äî which include energy  protein  and fat ‚Äî micronutrients are vitamins and minerals that are consumed in small quantities but are nonetheless essential for physical and mental development. Essential micronutrients include  but are not limited to: iron  zinc  calcium  iodine  vitamin A  B vitamins  and vitamin C. Deficiencies in these micronutrients are an important global health issue. They can result in poor physical and mental development in children  vulnerability or exacerbation of diseases  mental retardation  blindness  and general losses in productivity and potential. Unlike energy-protein undernourishment  the health impacts of micronutrient deficiency are not always acutely visible. Micronutrient deficiency is therefore sometimes termed ""hidden hunger""  and the two terms are often used interchangeably. Globally  it‚Äôs estimated that over half of children under five years old are micronutrient deficient (in at least one of iron  zinc  and vitamin A). In addition  over two-thirds of non-pregnant women of reproductive age are micronutrient deficient (in at least one of iron  zinc  and folate ‚Äî also known as vitamin B9).1 This topic page explores global trends in key micronutrient deficiencies  potential health and development impacts  and progress in interventions to address vitamin and mineral deficiencies."

This dataset is a cleaned version of the original version which can be foundhere. The data consist of contents added to Netflix from 2008 to 2021. The oldest content is as old as 1925 and the newest as 2021. This dataset will be cleaned with PostgreSQL and visualized with Tableau. The purpose of this dataset is to test my data cleaning and visualization skills. The cleaned data can be found below and the Tableau dashboard can be foundhere. We are going to: The director column nulls is about 30% of the whole column  therefore I will not delete them. I will rather find another column to populate it. To populate the director column  we want to find out if there is relationship between movie_cast column and director column Just like the director column  I will not delete the nulls in country. Since the country column is related to director and movie  we are going to populate the country column with the director column The date_added rows nulls is just 10 out of over 8000 rows  deleting them cannot affect our analysis or visualization rating nulls is 4. Delete them --duration nulls is 4. Delete them Now run the query to show the number of nulls in each column to confirm if there are still nulls. After this  run the query to confirm the row number in each column is the same We can drop the description and movie_cast column because they are not needed for our analysis or visualization task. Some of the rows in country column has multiple countries  for my visualization  I only need one country per row to make my map visualization clean and easy. Therefore  I am going to split the country column and retain the first country by the left which I believe is the original country of the movie Delete the country column that has multiple country entries Rename the country1 column to country After cleaning  the dataset is set for some analysis and visualization with Tableau. Note: In the visualization captions  Contents means Movies and TV shows  and Content may either mean Movie or TV Show. Sheet 1. Content type in percentage This first sheet shows the two categories of content in the dataset which are Movie and Tv show. Sheet 2. Movie & TV Show by Country This shows the the total amount of Movies and Tv shows per country within the given period of time(2008 - 2021). This can be noted by the size of the coloured circle in the map. We can see that the United State of America has the largest size  followed by India and the United Kingdom. In the Tableau hosted dashboard/sheet  there is a filter for the years between 2008 and 2021 to calculate yearly record. To give an alternate and a clearer view. Movie & TV shows by country bar chart is below Sheet 3. Number of Contents Added through the Years This time series chart shows the total number of contents added to Netflix all through the given years (2008 - 2021) Sheet 4. Top Directors This chart shows the top 10 directors with most contents on Netflix. This char shows the count of Movie and Tv shows in their catalouge. Sheet 5. Top Genres This chart shows the genres with the highest numbers on Netflix. Sheet 6. Top Ratings Rating is a system to rate motion picture's suitability for certain audiences based on its content. This chart shows the top ratings on Netflix-We can note that most contents on Netflix are rated TV-MA. TV-MA in the United States by the TV Parental Guidelines signifies content for mature audiences. Sheet 7. Oldest Contents on Netflix by Content Release year This table shows the 10 oldest movies and tv shows on Netflix Sheet 8. Content Types over the Years This line chart compares the Movie and Tv shows contents added to Netflix all through the years. Sheet 9. Release Years with Highest Contents This chart shows the Movies and Tv shows production year which has with highest contents on Netflix. We focus on the top 10 release year/production year.-We can see that from 2012 to 2018  Netflix added most recent contents  they made sure most recent contents per release year are higher than the older release year contents.  Then in 2019  it started dropping  this may be due to the Covid-19  but further analysis may be needed to determine this. And with this  I have come to the end of this exercise. As I said this is just an exercise to test my skills as I look forward to be better. Thanks for following through. Cheers!

Kalboard 360 is a multi-agent LMS  which has been designed to facilitate learning through the use of leading-edge technology. Such system provides users with a synchronous access to educational resources from any device with Internet connection. The data is collected using a learner activity tracker tool  which called experience API (xAPI). The xAPI is a component of the training and learning architecture (TLA) that enables to monitor learning progress and learner‚Äôs actions like reading an article or watching a training video. The experience API helps the learning activity providers to determine the learner  activity and objects that describe a learning experience.The dataset consists of 480 student records and 16 features. The features are classified into three major categories: (1) Demographic features such as gender and nationality. (2) Academic background features such as educational stage  grade Level and section. (3) Behavioral features such as raised hand on class  opening resources  answering survey by parents  and school satisfaction. The dataset consists of 305 males and 175 females. The students come from different origins such as 179 students are from Kuwait  172 students are from Jordan  28 students from Palestine  22 students are from Iraq  17 students from Lebanon  12 students from Tunis  11 students from Saudi Arabia  9 students from Egypt  7 students from Syria  6 students from USA  Iran and Libya  4 students from Morocco and one student from Venezuela. The dataset is collected through two educational semesters: 245 student records are collected during the first semester and 235 student records are collected during the second semester. The data set includes also the school attendance feature such as the students are classified into two categories based on their absence days: 191 students exceed 7 absence days and 289 students their absence days under 7. This dataset includes also a new category of features; this feature is parent parturition in the educational process. Parent participation feature have two sub features: Parent Answering Survey and Parent School Satisfaction.

Malicious URLs host unsolicited content (spam  phishing  drive-by downloads  etc.) and lure unsuspecting users to become victims of scams (monetary loss  theft of private information  and malware installation)  and cause losses of billions of dollars every year. We have collected this dataset to include a large number of examples of Malicious URLs so that a machine learning-based model can be developed to identify malicious urls so that we can stop them in advance before infecting computer system or spreading through inteinternet. we have collected a huge dataset of 651 191 URLs  out of which 428103 benign or safe URLs  96457 defacement URLs  94111 phishing URLs  and 32520 malware URLs. Figure 2 depicts their distribution in terms of percentage. As we know one of the most crucial tasks is to curate the dataset for a machine learning project. We have curated this dataset from five different sources. For collecting benign  phishing  malware and defacement URLs we have usedURL dataset (ISCX-URL-2016)For increasing phishing and malware URLs  we have usedMalware domain black list dataset. We have increased benign URLs usingfaizan git repoAt last  we have increased more number of phishing URLs usingPhishtank datasetandPhishStorm datasetAs we have told you that dataset is collected from different sources. So firstly  we have collected the URLs from different sources into a separate data frame and finally merge them to retain only URLs and their class type.

Both the Coronal and Axial cuts were selected from both contrast and non-contrast studies with protocol for the whole abdomen and urogram. The Dicom study was then carefully selected  one diagnosis at a time  and from those we created a batch of Dicom images of the region of interest for each radiological finding. Following that  we excluded each patient's information and meta data from the Dicom images and converted the Dicom images to a lossless jpg image format. After the conversion  each image finding was again verified by a radiologist and a medical technologist to reconfirm the correctness of the data.

Poor mental health affects our well-being  our ability to work  and our relationships with friends  family  and community. Mental health conditions are not uncommon. Hundreds of millions suffer from them yearly  and many more do over their lifetimes. It‚Äôs estimated that 1 in 3 women and 1 in 5 men will experience major depression in their lives. Other conditions  such as schizophrenia and bipolar disorder  are less common but still have a large impact on people‚Äôs lives. Mental health data based on surveysAside from the formal diagnoses  mental illnesses can be measured using surveys and screening questionnaires.These tend to ask people about symptoms similar to those in diagnostic manuals  but they can be used more easily and widely because the data does not need to be collected by a healthcare professional. What are the strengths and limitations of survey data?Strengths of survey dataSurvey data on mental health has two major strengths.First  it involves structured interviews ‚Äì people are asked a consistent set of questions regardless of their interviewer. This helps to ensure the data is more comparable between interviewers and across time.12Second  surveys include a much wider range of people in the population  including those who would not seek treatment due to a lack of awareness  costs  or other concerns. Limitations of survey data There are also several limitations of survey data to keep in mind.One is that people may not share their symptoms in surveys  as they may not feel comfortable sharing them with researchers. Along with this  people‚Äôs comfort in sharing mental health symptoms may vary between countries and over time.16Another limitation is that people may not remember their symptoms  especially when they are asked to recall symptoms in their lifetime so far. This can be challenging for older people whose symptoms may have occurred decades ago. By Saloni Dattani

You can find the full datasethere. This dataset was sourced fully from 2018  and will not be updated in the future  however  new versions of the dataset will be available at the link above. The dataset itself was based on logs of the university's servers  which found various DoS attacks throughout the publicly available period. When writing machine learning notebooks for this data  note that theLabelcolumn is arguably the most important portion of data  as it determines if the packets sent are malicious or not. Reference the belowColumn Structuresheading for more information about this and more columns. Data is divided into various files based on date. Each individual file is unbalanced  and it is up to the notebook creator to divide up the dataset into a balanced form for higher-quality predictions. In total  there are eighty columns within this dataset  each of which corresponds to an entry in the IDS logging system that the Unversity of New Brunswick has in place. Since their system classifies traffic as both forward and backward  there are columns for both. The most important columns within this dataset are listed below. For more information on this dataset  I recommend lookinghere  which links to the official University of New Brunswick website. To access more data  including the raw log files (which total to around 450 GB)  look at theAWS Open Data page. You need to download the AWS CLI for your operating system of choice previous to download the raw data. To download the data  typeaws s3 sync s3://cse-cic-ids2018/ [INSERT DOWNLOAD DIRECTORY HERE] --no-sign-request. You do not need an AWS account to copy data to your own device  hence the--no-sign-requestflag. Due to the large amount of data encompassed in the CSV files alone  you may want to pre-sort the data within Python  which will both speed up the actual processing of data in either PyTorch or TensorFlow.

Most people infected with COVID-19 virus will experience mild to moderate respiratory illness and recover without requiring special treatment. Older people  and those with underlying medical problems like cardiovascular disease  diabetes  chronic respiratory disease  and cancer are more likely to develop serious illness.During the entire course of the pandemic  one of the main problems that healthcare providers have faced is the shortage of medical resources and a proper plan to efficiently distribute them. In these tough times  being able to predict what kind of resource an individual might require at the time of being tested positive or even before that will be of immense help to the authorities as they would be able to procure and arrange for the resources necessary to save the life of that patient. The main goal of this project is to build a machine learning model that  given a Covid-19 patient's current symptom  status  and medical history  will predict whether the patient is in high risk or not.

The idea is to make a more exciting simple training set for image analysis than CIFAR10 or MNIST. For this reason the data includes massively downscaled versions of the images to enable quick tests. The data has been reformatted as HDF5 and specifically Keras HDF5Matrix which allows them to be easily read in. The file names indicate the contents of the file. For example food_c101_n1000_r384x384x3.h5 means there are 101 categories represented  with n=1000 images  that have a resolution of 384x384x3 (RGB  uint8) food_test_c101_n1000_r32x32x1.h5 means the data is part of the validation set  has 101 categories represented  with n=1000 images  that have a resolution of 32x32x1 (float32 from -1 to 1) The first goal is to be able to automatically classify an unknown image using the dataset  but beyond this there are a number of possibilities for looking at what regions / image components are important for making classifications  identify new types of food as combinations of existing tags  build object detectors which can find similar objects in a full scene.

Normally  older clients are more loyal and less likely to leave a bank.Balance‚Äîalso a very good indicator of customer churn  as people with a higher balance in their accounts are less likely to leave the bank compared to those with lower balances.NumOfProducts‚Äîrefers to the number of products that a customer has purchased through the bank.HasCrCard‚Äîdenotes whether or not a customer has a credit card. This column is also relevant  since people with a credit card are less likely to leave the bank.IsActiveMember‚Äîactive customers are less likely to leave the bank.EstimatedSalary‚Äîas with balance  people with lower salaries are more likely to leave the bank compared to those with higher salaries.Exited‚Äîwhether or not the customer left the bank.Complain‚Äîcustomer has complaint or not.Satisfaction Score‚ÄîScore provided by the customer for their complaint resolution.Card Type‚Äîtype of card hold by the customer.Points Earned‚Äîthe points earned by the customer for using credit card. Acknowledgements As we know  it is much more expensive to sign in a new client than keeping an existing one. It is advantageous for banks to know what leads a client towards the decision to leave the company. Churn prevention allows companies to develop loyalty programs and retention campaigns to keep as many customers as possible.

How would you describe this dataset? Metadata Collaborators Authors Coverage DOI Citation Provenance License Expected Update Frequency Activity Overview Views Downloads Engagement Comments Top Contributors Detail View Related Notebooks Similar Datasets,The primary reason for creating this dataset is the requirement of a good clean dataset of books. Being a bookie myself (see what I did there?) I had searched for datasets on books in kaggle itself - and I found out that while most of the datasets had a good amount of books listed  there were either a) major columns missing or b) grossly unclean data. I mean  you can't determine how good a book is just from a few text reviews  come on! What I needed were numbers  solid integers and floats that say how many people liked the book or hated it  how much did they like it  and stuff like that. Even thegood datasetthat I found was well-cleaned  it had a number of interlinked files  which increased the hassle. This prompted me to use the Goodreads API to get a well-cleaned dataset  with the promising features only ( minus the redundant ones )  and the result is the dataset you're at now. This data was entirely scraped via theGoodreads API  so kudos to them for providing such a simple interface to scrape their database. The reason behind creating this dataset is pretty straightforward  I'm listing the books for all book-lovers out there  irrespective of the language and publication and all of that. So go ahead and use it to your liking  find out what book you should be reading next ( there are very few free content recommendation systems that suggest books last I checked )  what are the details of every book you have read  create a word cloud from the books you want to read - all possible approaches to exploring this dataset are welcome.I started creating this dataset on May 25  2019  and intend to update it frequently.P.S. If you like this  please don't forget to give an upvote! You have the information about the publisher and the publication date now! Also  multiple authors are now delimited by '/'. Enjoy! Please read theGoodreads APIterms and conditions before you decide to use this dataset anywhere.All I can say is  this dataset was created in good faith to help bibliophiles like me. I will not be maintaining this dataset anymore because as of December 8th  2020  Goodreads no longer issues new developer keys for their public developer API and plans to retire the current version of these tools.

How would you describe this dataset? Metadata Collaborators Authors Coverage DOI Citation Provenance License Expected Update Frequency Activity Overview Views Downloads Engagement Comments Top Contributors Detail View Related Notebooks Similar Datasets,"The dataset consists of three files: a file with behaviour data (events.csv)  a file with item properties (item_properties.—Åsv) and a file  which describes category tree (category_tree.—Åsv). The data has been collected from a real-world ecommerce website. It is raw data  i.e. without any content transformations  however  all values are hashed due to confidential issues. The purpose of publishing is to motivate researches in the field of recommender systems with implicit feedback. The behaviour data  i.e. events like clicks  add to carts  transactions  represent interactions that were collected over a period of 4.5 months. A visitor can make three types of events  namely ‚Äúview‚Äù  ‚Äúaddtocart‚Äù or ‚Äútransaction‚Äù. In total there are 2 756 101 events including 2 664 312 views  69 332 add to carts and 22 457 transactions produced by  1 407 580 unique visitors. For about 90% of events corresponding properties can be found in the ‚Äúitem_properties.csv‚Äù file. For example: The file with item properties (item_properties.csv) includes 20 275 902 rows  i.e. different properties  describing 417 053 unique items. File is divided into 2 files due to file size limitations. Since the property of an item can vary in time (e.g.  price changes over time)  every row in the file has corresponding timestamp. In other words  the file consists of concatenated snapshots for every week in the file with the behaviour data. However  if a property of an item is constant over the observed period  only a single snapshot value will be present in the file.For example  we have three properties for single item and 4 weekly snapshots  like below: After snapshot merge it would looks like: Because property=100 is constant over time  property=200 has different values for all snapshots  property=300 has been changed once. Item properties file contain timestamp column because all of them are time dependent  since properties may change over time  e.g. price  category  etc. Initially  this file consisted of snapshots for every week in the events file and contained over 200 millions rows. We have merged consecutive constant  property values  so it's changed from snapshot form to change log form. Thus   constant  values would appear only once in the file. This action has significantly reduced the number of rows in 10 times. All values in the ‚Äúitem_properties.csv‚Äù file excluding ""categoryid"" and ""available"" properties were hashed.  Value of the ""categoryid"" property contains item category identifier. Value of the ""available"" property contains availability of the item  i.e. 1 means the item was available  otherwise 0. All numerical values were marked with ""n"" char at the beginning  and have 3 digits precision after decimal point  e.g.   ""5"" will become ""n5.000""  ""-3.67584"" will become ""n-3.675"". All words in text values were normalized (stemming procedure:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stemming) and hashed  numbers were processed as above  e.g. text ""Hello world 2017!"" will become ""24214 44214 n2017.000"" The category tree file has 1669 rows. Every row in the file specifies a child categoryId and the corresponding parent.For example: Retail Rocket (retailrocket.io) helps web shoppers make better shopping decisions by providing personalized real-time recommendations through multiple channels with over 100MM unique monthly users and 1000+ retail partners over the world. When a customer comes to an e-commerce site  he looks for a product with particular properties: price range  vendor  product type and etc. These properties are implicit  so it's hard to determine them through clicks log. Try to create an algorithm which predicts properties of items in ""addtocart"" event by using data from ""view"" events for any visitor in the published log. Process of analyzing ecommerce data include very important part of data cleaning. Researchers noticed that in some cases browsing data include up to 40% of abnormal traffic. Firstly  abnormal users add a lot of noise into data and make recommendation system less effective. In order to increase efficiency of recommendation system  abnormal users should be removed from the raw data. Secondly  abnormal users add bias to results of split tests  so this type of users should be removed also from split test data."

It is one of  if not the  the most popular personality test in the world. It is used in businesses  online  for fun  for research and lots more. A simple google search reveals all of the different ways the test has been used over time. It‚Äôs safe to say that this test is still very relevant in the world in terms of its use. From scientific or psychological perspective it is based on the work done oncognitive functionsby Carl Jung i.e. Jungian Typology. This was a model of 8 distinct functions  thought processes or ways of thinking that were suggested to be present in the mind. Later this work was transformed into several different personality systems to make it more accessible  the most popular of which is of course the MBTI. Recently  its use/validity has come into question because of unreliability in experiments surrounding it  among other reasons. But it is still clung to as being a very useful tool in a lot of areas  and the purpose of this dataset is to help see if any patterns can be detected in specific types and their style of writing  which overall explores the validity of the test in analysing  predicting or categorising behaviour. This dataset contains over 8600 rows of data  on each row is a person‚Äôs: This data was collected through thePersonalityCafe forum  as it provides a large selection of people and their MBTI personality type  as well as what they have written.

The second rating corresponds to the degree to which the auto is more risky than its price indicates. Cars are initially assigned a risk factor symbol associated with its price. Then  if it is more risky (or less)  this symbol is adjusted by moving it up (or down) the scale. Actuarians call this process ""symboling"". A value of +3 indicates that the auto is risky  -3 that it is probably pretty safe. The third factor is the relative average loss payment per insured vehicle year. This value is normalized for all autos within a particular size classification (two-door small  station wagons  sports/speciality  etc‚Ä¶)  and represents the average loss per car per year.

The satellite attained orbital insertion atLagrange Point 1(L1)  ~1.5 million kilometers from Earth  onJanuary 6  2024  4:17 PM IST  marking a significant milestone for India's first solar observatory. The advantage of being perched (in a halo orbit) at L1 is that Aditya-L1 has secured for itself an astronomical seat with a forever uninterrupted view of the Sun. Aditya-L1 carries seven payloads to observe the photosphere  chromosphere and the corona of the Sun. This dataset is particularly from theSolar Low Energy X-ray Spectrometer (SoLEXS)  a sun-as-a-star spectrometer developed by the U.R. Rao Satellite Centre  Bengaluru. The primary science objectives of SoLEXS are: ISRO releases data in tranches. The first tranche of solar datasets was released on January 6  2025  marking the one-year anniversary of Aditya-L1's arrival at L1. SoLEXS data is hosted by ISRO'sIndian Space Science Data Centre(ISSDC) on thePRADAN portal  where one can access it after a quick registration process. Solar flares are classified on a scale of A  B  C  M and X. Each class is 10 times stronger than the last  with X-class flares being the most powerful SoLEXS is capable of covering an extensive dynamic range from A-class to X-class flares. When the Sun flares  the intensity of X-Ray counts can be several standard deviations above the mean. ISRO presents SoLEXS data inFITS  the preferred format for astronomical data.

Each entry provides: Basic Attributes: Title  genre  release year  average rating  and review volume.Transformative Insights: A precise timestamp for the ‚ÄúMinute of Life-Changing Insight‚Äù and the actionable advice viewers derived from it.Audience Engagement: Discovery channels (e.g.  friend recommendations  social media)  the percentage of viewers who shared the film‚Äôs lesson  and qualitative review highlights. This dataset transcends traditional movie analytics by spotlighting thehuman impact of storytelling‚Äîhow scenes spark introspection  alter perspectives  or inspire action. It bridges cinema studies  psychology  and data science  making it invaluable for understanding art‚Äôs role in shaping human behavior. Context and InspirationAs a data scientist and lifelong film enthusiast  I noticed a critical gap: most movie datasets focus on box office metrics or superficial ratings  ignoringwhycertain stories resonate deeply. This project began with a simple question:What makes a film unforgettable? üí°Did a scene ever redefine your worldview?That fleeting moment when a character‚Äôs struggle mirrors your own  or a line of dialogue becomes a mantra‚Äîthis dataset captures those universal yet deeply personal catalysts for change. I spent months analyzing thousands of reviews  cross-referencing critical essays  and identifying recurring themes in viewer testimonials. From Oscar-winning dramas to cult classics  every entry reflects rigorous validation to ensure authenticity and relevance. Sources and MethodologyAccuracy is paramount.Data was manually aggregated and verified using: Every ‚Äúlife-changing minute‚Äù and its associated advice underwent cross-validation against multiple sources to ensure universality.

The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING  WALKING_UPSTAIRS  WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS  SITTING  STANDING  LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope  we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets  where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data. The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). The sensor acceleration signal  which has gravitational and body motion components  was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration and gravity. The gravitational force is assumed to have only low frequency components  therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used. From each window  a vector of features was obtained by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain. For each record in the dataset the following is provided: Triaxial acceleration from the accelerometer (total acceleration) and the estimated body acceleration. Triaxial Angular velocity from the gyroscope. A 561-feature vector with time and frequency domain variables. Its activity label. An identifier of the subject who carried out the experiment.

Extremely complex underwriting rule-sets that are radically different in different product lines  many non-KYC environments with a lack of centralized customer information base  complex relationship with consumers in traditional risk underwriting where sometimes customer centricity runs reverse to business profit  inertia of regulatory compliance  - are some of the unique challenges faced by Insurance Business. Despite this  emergent technologies like AI and Block Chain have brought a radical change in Insurance  and Data Analytics sits at the core of this transformation. We can identify 4 key factors behind the emergence of Analytics as a crucial part of InsurTech: This dataset can be helpful in a simple yet illuminating study in understanding the risk underwriting in Health Insurance  the interplay of various attributes of the insured and see how they affect the insurance premium. This dataset contains 1338 rows of insured data  where the Insurance charges are given against the following attributes of the insured: Age  Sex  BMI  Number of Children  Smoker and Region. There are no missing or undefined values in the dataset. This relatively simple dataset should be an excellent starting point for EDA  Statistical Analysis and Hypothesis testing and training Linear Regression models for predicting Insurance Premium Charges.

However  it only takes a glimpse of the data to see that there are huge differences across societies. The map here provides a picture of how men and women compare today in terms of participation in labor markets  country by country. Shown is the female-to-male ratio in labor force participation rates (expressed in percent). These figures show estimates from the International Labor Organization (ILO). These are 'modeled estimates' in the sense that the ILO produces them after harmonizing various data sources to improve comparability across countries. As we can see  the numbers for most countries are well below 100%  which means that the participation of women tends to be lower than that of men. Yet differences are outstanding: in some countries  the ratio is below 25%. In others  the ratio is close to  or even slightly above 100% (i.e. there is gender parity in labor force participation or even a higher share of women participating in the labor market than men).

So normally they tun A/B tests  that is a randomized experimentation process wherein two or more versions of a variable (differential messaging  web page  page element  banner  etc.) are shown to different segments of people at the same time to determine which version leaves the maximum impact and drive business metrics. The companies are interested in answering two questions: Would the campaign be successful?If the campaign was successful  how much of that success could be attributed to the personalized messaging?With the second question in mind  we normally do an A/B test. The majority of the people will be exposed to personalized messaging (the experimental group). And a small portion of people (the control group) would instead see a generic type of advertisement (or nothing) in the exact topic and date the personalized messaging would normally be sent. The idea of the dataset is to analyze the groups  find if the personalized messaging were successful  how much the engagement increases(or decreases) from the personalized messaging  and if the difference between the groups is statistically significant.

Metadata Collaborators Authors Coverage DOI Citation Provenance License Expected Update Frequency Activity Overview Views Downloads Engagement Comments Top Contributors Detail View Related Notebooks Similar Datasets,Good health is fundamental for a high quality of life  as it influences our ability to enjoy life and participate in daily activities. On this page  we provide an overview of global health  emphasizing data on health outcomes ‚Äì such as disease and death ‚Äì and the effects of healthcare investments. We begin by examining life expectancy  a primary indicator of population health. Historical trends show us there have been significant increases in global life expectancy over the last two centuries  reflecting improvements around the world. Notably  poorer countries have made considerable progress  which has helped reduce the global disparity in life expectancy. But substantial gaps remain  with life expectancies in some Sub-Saharan African countries below 60 years  in contrast to over 80 years in several European countries and Japan. Large reductions in child and maternal mortality have been central to the improvement in life expectancy worldwide. But life expectancy has risen across all age groups. Despite these advancements  disparities persist ‚Äî child mortality rates in low-income countries are substantially higher than those in high-income countries. This pattern extends to other health measures  including disease burden estimates  indicating ongoing global health challenges. A growing body of research highlights the effectiveness of healthcare investments in improving health outcomes. Evidence shows that health outcomes respond positively to increased healthcare spending  particularly at lower levels of expenditure. This suggests that appropriately targeted and managed international health aid can significantly reduce global health inequalities  and improve living standards worldwide.

What's interesting is that this dataset is male only and is of very high quality audio. Because the male only speaker will bring about a slightly imbalance representation  it would be advisable to complement other datasets with more female speakers The SAVEE database was recorded from four native English male speakers (identified as DC  JE  JK  KL)  postgraduate students and researchers at the University of Surrey aged from 27 to 31 years. Emotion has been described psychologically in discrete categories: anger  disgust  fear  happiness  sadness and surprise. A neutral category is also added to provide recordings of 7 emotion categories. The text material consisted of 15 TIMIT sentences per emotion: 3 common  2 emotion-specific and 10 generic sentences that were different for each emotion and phonetically-balanced. The 3 common and 2 √ó 6 = 12 emotion-specific sentences were recorded as neutral to give 30 neutral sentences. This resulted in a total of 120 utterances per speaker I wanted to thank University of Surrey for putting together this awesomedataset!

Metadata Collaborators Authors Coverage DOI Citation Provenance License Expected Update Frequency Activity Overview Views Downloads Engagement Comments Top Contributors Detail View Similar Datasets,Context & BackgroundAccess to high-quality  domain-specific healthcare data remains a challenge for AI startups and researchers in India. Most publicly available datasets lack structure  standardization  and regional relevance. While Indian healthcare startups are growing rapidly  there's a visible gap in data infrastructure that supports local languages  symptom profiles  and disease mapping ‚Äî especially at the early diagnostic stage. InspirationThis dataset was created out of necessity. While building internal healthcare tools for chatbot-based diagnostics and research models  we found that most global symptom datasets missed critical Indian nuances. There was little to no localization  and even basic symptoms like ‚Äúloose motion‚Äù or ‚Äúbody heat‚Äù were unaccounted for in most repositories. We decided to build the dataset we wished existed ‚Äî one that reflects the actual way people report symptoms across India‚Äôs diverse linguistic and regional landscape. Sources UsedThe dataset is compiled using publicly available medical knowledge bases  government health portals (e.g.  MoHFW India)  regional clinical guidelines  and cross-referenced with trusted medical literature (AIIMS  ICMR papers). Language terms were validated with native speakers for clarity and accuracy.It is not scraped from any copyrighted app or proprietary source. Instead  it was manually curated and reviewed to ensure consistency  correctness  and cultural alignment.

Furthermore  many tweets are replies to other tweets and detecting sarcasm in these requires the availability of contextual tweets. To overcome the limitations related to noise in Twitter datasets  thisNews Headlines dataset for Sarcasm Detectionis collected from two news website.TheOnionaims at producing sarcastic versions of current events and we collected all the headlines from News in Brief and News in Photos categories (which are sarcastic). We collect real (and non-sarcastic) news headlines fromHuffPost. This new dataset has following advantages over the existing Twitter datasets: Since news headlines are written by professionals in a formal manner  there are no spelling mistakes and informal usage. This reduces the sparsity and also increases the chance of finding pre-trained embeddings. Furthermore  since the sole purpose ofTheOnionis to publish sarcastic news  we get high-quality labels with much less noise as compared to Twitter datasets. Unlike tweets which are replies to other tweets  the news headlines we obtained are self-contained. This would help us in teasing apart the real sarcastic elements. Each record consists of three attributes: is_sarcastic: 1 if the record is sarcastic otherwise 0 headline: the headline of the news article article_link: link to the original news article. Useful in collecting supplementary data General statistics of data  instructions on how to read the data in python  and basic exploratory analysis could be found atthis GitHub repo.

This wide-ranging tapestry of residential choices reflects the significant expansion witnessed in India's housing sector  which has paralleled the upward trajectory of income levels in the country. According to the findings of the Human Rights Measurement Initiative  India currently achieves 60.9% of what is theoretically attainable  considering its current income levels  in ensuring the fundamental right to housing for its citizens. In the realm of housing arrangements  renting  known interchangeably as hiring or letting  constitutes an agreement wherein compensation is provided for the temporary utilization of a resource  service  or property owned by another party. Within this arrangement  a gross lease is one where the tenant is obligated to pay a fixed rental amount  and the landlord assumes responsibility for covering all ongoing property-related expenses. The concept of renting also aligns with the principles of the sharing economy  as it fosters the utilization of assets and resources among individuals or entities  promoting efficiency and access to housing solutions for a broad spectrum of individuals. Within this dataset  you will find a comprehensive collection of data pertaining to nearly 4700+ available residential properties  encompassing houses  apartments  and flats offered for rent. This dataset is rich with various attributes  including the number of bedrooms (BHK)  rental rates  property size  number of floors  area type  locality  city  furnishing status  tenant preferences  bathroom count  and contact information for the respective point of contact.

The grand prize was $1 000 000 and was won by BellKor's Pragmatic Chaos team. This is the dataset that was used in that competition. This comes directly from the README: The file ""training_set.tar"" is a tar of a directory containing 17770 files  oneper movie.  The first line of each file contains the movie id followed by acolon.  Each subsequent line in the file corresponds to a rating from a customerand its date in the following format: CustomerID Rating Date Movie information in ""movie_titles.txt"" is in the following format: MovieID YearOfRelease Title The qualifying dataset for the Netflix Prize is contained in the text file""qualifying.txt"".  It consists of lines indicating a movie id  followed by acolon  and then customer ids and rating dates  one per line for that movie id.The movie and customer ids are contained in the training set.  Of course theratings are withheld. There are no empty lines in the file. MovieID1: CustomerID11 Date11 CustomerID12 Date12 ‚Ä¶ MovieID2: CustomerID21 Date21 CustomerID22 Date22 For the Netflix Prize  your program must predict the all ratings the customersgave the movies in the qualifying dataset based on the information in thetraining dataset. The format of your submitted prediction file follows the movie and customer id date order of the qualifying dataset.  However  your predicted rating takes theplace of the corresponding customer id (and date)  one per line. For example  if the qualifying dataset looked like: 111: 3245 2005-12-19 5666 2005-12-23 6789 2005-03-14 225: 1234 2005-05-26 3456 2005-11-07 then a prediction file should look something like: 111: 3.0 3.4 4.0 225: 1.0 2.0 which predicts that customer 3245 would have rated movie 111 3.0 stars on the19th of Decemeber  2005  that customer 5666 would have rated it slightly higherat 3.4 stars on the 23rd of Decemeber  2005  etc. You must make predictions for all customers for all movies in the qualifyingdataset. To allow you to test your system before you submit a prediction set based on thequalifying dataset  we have provided a probe dataset in the file ""probe.txt"".This text file contains lines indicating a movie id  followed by a colon  andthen customer ids  one per line for that movie id. MovieID1: CustomerID11 CustomerID12 ‚Ä¶ MovieID2: CustomerID21 CustomerID22 Like the qualifying dataset  the movie and customer id pairs are contained inthe training set.  However  unlike the qualifying dataset  the ratings (anddates) for each pair are contained in the training dataset. If you wish  you may calculate the RMSE of your predictions against thoseratings and compare your RMSE against the Cinematch RMSE on the same data.  Seehttp://www.netflixprize.com/faq#probefor that value. The training data came in 17 000+ files. In the interest of keeping files together and file sizes as low as possible  I combined them into four text files: combined_data_(1 2 3 4).txt The contest was originally hosted athttp://netflixprize.com/index.html The dataset was downloaded fromhttps://archive.org/download/nf_prize_dataset.tar This is a fun dataset to work with.

Metadata Collaborators Authors Coverage DOI Citation Provenance License Expected Update Frequency Activity Overview Views Downloads Engagement Comments Top Contributors Detail View Related Notebooks Similar Datasets,The Comprehensive Nutritional Food Database provides detailed nutritional information for a wide range of food items commonly consumed around the world. This dataset aims to support dietary planning  nutritional analysis  and educational purposes by providing extensive data on the macro and micronutrient content of foods. The dataset is structured as a CSV (Comma-Separated Values) file  which can easily be imported into most data analysis tools and software for further processing and analysis. This dataset is invaluable for researchers in nutritional science  dietitians planning meals  healthcare providers advising on dietary options  and individuals tracking their food intake. It can be used to: Machine learning algorithms can analyze trends and patterns in candy consumption  linking them to nutritional impacts. For example  clustering techniques can identify common characteristics of high-calorie candies or those high in certain nutrients like sugars. By integrating this dataset with broader dietary data  machine learning models can recommend dietary adjustments to individuals. For instance  a recommendation system could suggest lower-calorie or lower-sugar candy alternatives to users looking to reduce their sugar intake but who still want to enjoy sweets. With sufficient data linking candy consumption to health outcomes  predictive models could forecast health impacts based on candy consumption patterns. This could be particularly useful for medical research or public health studies examining the effects of sugar and additives on long-term health. Machine learning can help in formulating new candy recipes by predicting the nutritional content based on ingredients. This could aid manufacturers in creating healthier candy options that maintain taste while reducing undesirable nutrients like sugars or synthetic additives. Using classification or regression models  businesses can predict consumer preferences for certain types of candies based on nutritional information and demographic data. This insight can drive targeted marketing and product development strategies. Machine learning models can be trained to predict the quality and consistency of candy based on variations in manufacturing parameters and ingredient quality. This application would be especially useful in industrial settings to maintain high standards. By applying natural language processing (NLP) techniques to product reviews and feedback  companies can extract consumer sentiments related to specific nutritional aspects of candies. This could guide improvements in product formulations and marketing strategies. Analyzing candy sales and nutritional preferences with machine learning can optimize supply chains by predicting demand fluctuations based on health trends and nutritional awareness. Developing interactive machine learning applications that teach users about nutrition using candy as a case study. Such tools can visualize the impact of different candies on dietary intake and encourage healthier eating habits. Machine learning models can integrate candy consumption data into broader dietary tracking tools used in fitness and health apps  providing users with insights into how occasional treats like candies fit into their overall dietary goals.These use cases demonstrate how a dataset with seemingly narrow focus can have broad applications across health  industry  consumer insights  and education  leveraging the power of machine learning to extract and predict valuable insights. The dataset is available for download from our official repository  and can be accessed freely for academic and research purposes. To ensure the dataset is kept current and comprehensive  it will be updated consistently with new food items and revised nutrient values as new research becomes available. Collaborators worldwide contribute to the data collection  ensuring a diverse and representative dataset of global food items.

The whole point is  however  to provide a common dataset for linear regression. Although such a dataset can easily be generated in Excel with random numbers  results would not be comparable. The training dataset is a CSV file with 700 data pairs (x y). The x-values are numbers between 0 and 100. The corresponding y-values have been generated using the Excel function NORMINV(RAND()  x  3). Consequently  the best estimate for y should be x.The test dataset is a CSV file with 300 data pairs. Thank you  Dan Bricklin and Bob Frankston for inventing the first spreadsheet. I hope this dataset will encourage all newbies to enter the world of machine learning  possibly starting with a simple linear regression. Obviously  data is free.

Since releasing the dataset we have noticed a couple of common mistakes that could invalidate your results  potentially leading to manuscripts being rejected or the publication of incorrect results. To avoid this  please read the following carefully: Why?If you reshuffle the data (e.g. combine the data from all folds and generate a random train/test split) you will be incorrectly placing related samples in both the train and test sets  leading to inflated scores that don't represent your model's performance on unseen data. Put simply  your results will be wrong.Your results will NOT be comparable to previous results in the literature  meaning any claims to an improvement on previous research will be invalid. Even if you don't reshuffle the data  evaluating using different splits (e.g. 5-fold cross validation) will mean your results are not comparable to previous research. Why?Not all the splits are as ""easy"". That is  models tend to obtain much higher scores when trained on folds 1-9 and tested on fold 10  compared to (e.g.) training on folds 2-10 and testing on fold 1. For this reason  it is important to evaluate your model on each of the 10 splits and report the average accuracy.Again  your results will NOT be comparable to previous results in the literature. We kindly request that articles and other works in which this dataset is used cite the following paper: J. Salamon  C. Jacoby and J. P.

Further information on the dataset contents and conversion process can be found in the paper available athttps://arxiv.org/abs/1702.05373v1. There are six different splits provided in this dataset and each are provided in two formats: The full complement of the NIST Special Database 19 is available in the ByClass and ByMerge splits. These two datasets have the same image information but differ in the number of images in each class. Both datasets have an uneven number of images per class and there are more digits than letters. The number of letters roughly equate to the frequency of use in the English language. The EMNIST Balanced dataset is meant to address the balance issues in the ByClass and ByMerge datasets. It is derived from the ByMerge dataset to reduce mis-classification errors due to capital and lower case letters and also has an equal number of samples per class. This dataset is meant to be the most applicable. The EMNIST Letters dataset merges a balanced set of the uppercase and lowercase letters into a single 26-class task.

The current version supports both extractive and abstractive summarization  though the original version was created for machine reading and comprehension and abstractive question answering. The BCP-47 code for English as generally spoken in the United States is en-US and the BCP-47 code for English as generally spoken in the United Kingdom is en-GB. It is unknown if other varieties of English are represented in the data. For each instance  there is a string for the article  a string for the highlights  and a string for the id. See theCNN / Daily Mail dataset viewerto explore more examples. The average token count for the articles and the highlights are provided below: The CNN/DailyMail dataset has 3 splits:train validation  andtest. Below are the statistics for Version 3.0.0 of the dataset. Version 1.0.0 aimed to support supervised neural methodologies for machine reading and question answering with a large amount of real natural language training data and released about 313k unique articles and nearly 1M Cloze style questions to go with the articles. Versions 2.0.0 and 3.0.0 changed the structure of the dataset to support summarization rather than question answering. Version 3.0.0 provided a non-anonymized version of the data  whereas both the previous versions were preprocessed to replace named entities with unique identifier labels. The data consists of news articles and highlight sentences. In the question answering setting of the data  the articles are used as the context and entities are hidden one at a time in the highlight sentences  producing Cloze style questions where the goal of the model is to correctly guess which entity in the context has been hidden in the highlight. In the summarization setting  the highlight sentences are concatenated to form a summary of the article. The CNN articles were written between April 2007 and April 2015. The Daily Mail articles were written between June 2010 and April 2015. The code for the original data collection is available athttps://github.com/deepmind/rc-data. The articles were downloaded using archives of <www.cnn.com>and <www.dailymail.co.uk>on the Wayback Machine. Articles were not included in the Version 1.0.0 collection if they exceeded 2000 tokens. Due to accessibility issues with the Wayback Machine  Kyunghyun Cho has made the datasets available athttps://cs.nyu.edu/~kcho/DMQA/. An updated version of the code that does not anonymize the data is available athttps://github.com/abisee/cnn-dailymail. Hermann et al provided their own tokenization script. The script provided by See uses the PTBTokenizer. It also lowercases the text and adds periods to lines missing them. Version 3.0 is not anonymized  so individuals' names can be found in the dataset. Information about the original author is not included in the dataset. The purpose of this dataset is to help develop models that can summarize long paragraphs of text in one or two sentences. This task is useful for efficiently presenting information given a large quantity of text. It should be made clear that any summarizations produced by models trained on this dataset are reflective of the language used in the articles  but are in fact automatically generated. Bordia and Bowman (2019)explore measuring gender bias and debiasing techniques in the CNN / Dailymail dataset  the Penn Treebank  and WikiText-2. They find the CNN / Dailymail dataset to have a slightly lower gender bias based on their metric compared to the other datasets  but still show evidence of gender bias when looking at words such as 'fragile'. Because the articles were written by and for people in the US and the UK  they will likely present specifically US and UK perspectives and feature events that are considered relevant to those populations during the time that the articles were published. News articles have been shown to conform to writing conventions in which important information is primarily presented in the first third of the article(Kry≈õci≈Ñski et al  2019).Chen et al (2016)conducted a manual study of 100 random instances of the first version of the dataset and found 25% of the samples to be difficult even for humans to answer correctly due to ambiguity and coreference errors. It should also be noted that machine-generated summarizations  even when extractive  may differ in truth values when compared to the original articles. The data was originally collected by Karl Moritz Hermann  Tom√°≈° Koƒçisk√Ω  Edward Grefenstette  Lasse Espeholt  Will Kay  Mustafa Suleyman  and Phil Blunsom of Google DeepMind. Tom√°≈° Koƒçisk√Ω and Phil Blunsom are also affiliated with the University of Oxford. They released scripts to collect and process the data into the question answering format. Ramesh Nallapati  Bowen Zhou  Cicero dos Santos  and Bing Xiang of IMB Watson and √áaƒülar GuÃál√ßehre of Universit√© de Montr√©al modified Hermann et al's collection scripts to restore the data to a summary format. They also produced both anonymized and non-anonymized versions. The code for the non-anonymized version is made publicly available by Abigail See of Stanford University  Peter J. Liu of Google Brain and Christopher D. Manning of Stanford University athttps://github.com/abisee/cnn-dailymail. The work at Stanford University was supported by the DARPA DEFT ProgramAFRL contract no. FA8750-13-2-0040. The CNN / Daily Mail dataset version 1.0.0 is released under theApache-2.0 License.

It includes 3 paired-end RNA-seq samples (anoxia-treated). The data was aligned using HISAT2 to a custom reference genome of T. scripta elegans available at the same link. Alignment logs are included. The resulting SAM/BAM files were processed and sorted using SAMtools  and accompanying index files (.bai) were generated. Flagstat statistics (both partial and full) from SAMtools are provided for quality assessment. Gene-level quantification was performed with featureCounts  and transcript assembly was conducted using StringTie‚Äîall using the same reference annotation. Logs for both steps are included. The aim of the project is to investigate gene expression changes and the molecular basis of hypometabolism and anoxia tolerance in freshwater turtles  with broader implications for stress physiology and evolutionary biology.

Fish Market,https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vipullrathod/fish-market,Fish Market Fish Market About Dataset Usability License Expected update frequency Tags Fish.csv(6.02 kB) Data Explorer Summary See what others are saying about this dataset What have you used this dataset for? How would you describe this dataset? Metadata Collaborators Authors Coverage DOI Citation Provenance License Expected Update Frequency Activity Overview Views Downloads Engagement Comments Top Contributors Detail View Related Notebooks Similar Datasets,"The fish market dataset is a collection of data related to various species of fish and their characteristics. This dataset is designed for polynomial regression analysis and contains several columns with specific information. Here's a description of each column in the dataset: Species: This column represents the species of the fish. It is a categorical variable that categorizes each fish into one of seven species. The species may include names like ""Perch "" ""Bream "" ""Roach "" ""Pike "" ""Smelt "" ""Parkki "" and ""Whitefish."" This column is the target variable for the polynomial regression analysis  where we aim to predict the fish's weight based on its other attributes. Weight: This column represents the weight of the fish. It is a numerical variable that is typically measured in grams. The weight is the dependent variable we want to predict using polynomial regression. Length1: This column represents the first measurement of the fish's length. It is a numerical variable  typically measured in centimetres. Length2: This column represents the second measurement of the fish's length. It is another numerical variable  typically measured in centimetres. Length3: This column represents the third measurement of the fish's length. Similar to the previous two columns  it is a numerical variable  usually measured in centimetres. Height: This column represents the height of the fish. It is a numerical variable  typically measured in centimetres. Width: This column represents the width of the fish. Like the other numerical variables  it is also typically measured in centimetres. The dataset is structured in such a way that each row corresponds to a single fish with its species and various physical measurements (lengths  height  and width). The goal of using polynomial regression on this dataset would be to build a predictive model that can estimate the weight of a fish based on its species and the provided physical measurements. Polynomial regression allows for modelling more complex relationships between the independent variables (lengths  height  and width) and the dependent variable (weight)  which may be particularly useful if there are non-linear patterns in the data."

How would you describe this dataset? Metadata Collaborators Authors Coverage DOI Citation Provenance License Expected Update Frequency Activity Overview Views Downloads Engagement Comments Top Contributors Detail View Related Notebooks Similar Datasets,The dataset contains 2000 rows of house-related data  representing various features that could influence house prices. Below  we discuss key aspects of the dataset  which include its structure  the choice of features  and potential use cases for analysis. The dataset is designed to capture essential attributes for predicting house prices  including: Area: Square footage of the house  which is generally one of the most important predictors of price.Bedrooms & Bathrooms: The number of rooms in a house significantly affects its value. Homes with more rooms tend to be priced higher.Floors: The number of floors in a house could indicate a larger  more luxurious home  potentially raising its price.Year Built: The age of the house can affect its condition and value. Newly built houses are generally more expensive than older ones.Location: Houses in desirable locations such as downtown or urban areas tend to be priced higher than those in suburban or rural areas.Condition: The current condition of the house is critical  as well-maintained houses (in 'Excellent' or 'Good' condition) will attract higher prices compared to houses in 'Fair' or 'Poor' condition.Garage: Availability of a garage can increase the price due to added convenience and space.Price: The target variable  representing the sale price of the house  used to train machine learning models to predict house prices based on the other features. Area Distribution: The area of the houses in the dataset ranges from 500 to 5000 square feet  which allows analysis across different types of homes  from smaller apartments to larger luxury houses.Bedrooms and Bathrooms: The number of bedrooms varies from 1 to 5  and bathrooms from 1 to 4. This variance enables analysis of homes with different sizes and layouts.Floors: Houses in the dataset have between 1 and 3 floors. This feature could be useful for identifying the influence of multi-level homes on house prices.Year Built: The dataset contains houses built from 1900 to 2023  giving a wide range of house ages to analyze the effects of new vs. older construction.Location: There is a mix of urban  suburban  downtown  and rural locations. Urban and downtown homes may command higher prices due to proximity to amenities.Condition: Houses are labeled as 'Excellent'  'Good'  'Fair'  or 'Poor'. This feature helps model the price differences based on the current state of the house.Price Distribution: Prices range between $50 000 and $1 000 000  offering a broad spectrum of property values. This range makes the dataset appropriate for predicting a wide variety of housing prices  from affordable homes to luxury properties. A key area of interest is the relationship between various features and house price:Area and Price: Typically  a strong positive correlation is expected between the size of the house (Area) and its price. Larger homes are likely to be more expensive.Location and Price: Location is another major factor. Houses in urban or downtown areas may show a higher price on average compared to suburban and rural locations.Condition and Price: The condition of the house should show a positive correlation with price. Houses in better condition should be priced higher  as they require less maintenance and repair.Year Built and Price: Newer houses might command a higher price due to better construction standards  modern amenities  and less wear-and-tear  but some older homes in good condition may retain historical value.Garage and Price: A house with a garage may be more expensive than one without  as it provides extra storage or parking space. The dataset is well-suited for various machine learning and data analysis applications  including: House Price Prediction: Using regression techniques  this dataset can be used to build a model to predict house prices based on the available features.Feature Importance Analysis: By using techniques such as feature importance ranking  data scientists can determine which features (e.g.  location  area  or condition) have the greatest impact on house prices.Clustering: Clustering techniques like k-means could help identify patterns in the data  such as grouping houses into segments based on their characteristics (e.g.  luxury homes  affordable homes).Market Segmentation: The dataset can be used to perform segmentation by location  price range  or house type to analyze trends in specific sub-markets  like luxury vs. affordable housing.Time-Based Analysis: By studying how house prices vary with the year built or the age of the house  analysts can derive insights into the trends of older vs. newer homes. Random Generation of Data: Since this dataset was generated randomly  it lacks the real-world complexity found in actual housing markets. Real-world data might have more nuanced relationships between the features and price.Lack of External Factors: The dataset does not include external factors such as proximity to schools  public transport  crime rates  or other neighborhood amenities  which could significantly affect house prices.No Seasonality or Economic Trends: The dataset does not capture trends over time  such as changes in house prices due to economic shifts  interest rates  or seasonal buying patterns. This dataset provides a simplified yet valuable foundation for exploring various data science and machine learning approaches in house price prediction. While the randomly generated data may not fully reflect the complexity of a real estate market  it offers a platform for students and researchers to practice predictive modeling  feature analysis  and pattern recognition. Further enhancements  such as adding real-world factors  could make the dataset even more powerful for accurate price prediction models.

Ranking universities is a difficult  political  and controversial practice. There are hundreds of different national and international university ranking systems  many of which disagree with each other. This dataset contains three global university rankings from very different places. TheTimes Higher Education World University Rankingis widely regarded as one of the most influential and widely observed university measures. Founded in the United Kingdom in 2010  it has been criticized for its commercialization and for undermining non-English-instructing institutions. TheAcademic Ranking of World Universities  also known as the Shanghai Ranking  is an equally influential ranking. It was founded in China in 2003 and has been criticized for focusing on raw research power and for undermining humanities and quality of instruction. TheCenter for World University Rankings  is a less well know listing that comes from Saudi Arabia  it was founded in 2012. To further extend your analyses  we've also included two sets of supplementary data. The first of these is a set of data oneducational attainmentaround the world. It comes from The World Data Bank and comprises information from the UNESCO Institute for Statistics and the Barro-Lee Dataset. How does national educational attainment relate to the quality of each nation's universities? The second supplementary dataset contains information aboutpublic and private direct expenditure on education across nations. This data comes from the National Center for Education Statistics. It represents expenditure as a percentage of gross domestic product. Does spending more on education lead to better international university rankings?

Scraped data of used cars listings. 100 000 listings  which have been separated into files corresponding to each car manufacturer. I collected the data to make a tool to predict how much my friend should sell his old car for compared to other stuff on the market  and then just extended the data set. Then made a more general car value regression model. Picked two fairly common cars on the British market for analysis (Ford Focus and Mercedes C Class). The hope is to find info such as: when is the ideal time to sell certain cars (i.e. at what age and mileage are there significant drops in resale value). Also can make comparisons between the two  and make a classifier for a ford or Mercedes car. Can easily add more makes and models  so comment for any request e.g. if you want a big data set of all Mercedes makes and models. The cleaned data set contains information of price  transmission  mileage  fuel type  road tax  miles per gallon (mpg)  and engine size. I've removed duplicate listings and cleaned the columns  but have included a notebook showing the process and the original data for anyone who wants to check/improve my work. It'd be cool to have some insights and visualisations of the data. Also  am open to ideas on how to expand the data set.

Metadata Collaborators Authors Coverage DOI Citation Provenance License Expected Update Frequency Activity Overview Views Downloads Engagement Comments Top Contributors Detail View Related Notebooks Similar Datasets,The lack of publicly available National Football League (NFL) data sources has been a major obstacle in the creation of modern  reproducible research in football analytics.  While clean play-by-play data is available via open-source software packages in other sports (e.g. nhlscrapr for hockey; PitchF/x data in baseball; the Basketball Reference for basketball)  the equivalent datasets are not freely available for researchers interested in the statistical analysis of the NFL.  To solve this issue  a group ofCarnegie Mellon University statistical researchersincluding Maksim Horowitz  Ron Yurko  and Sam Ventura  built and releasednflscrapRan R package which uses an API maintained by the NFL to scrape  clean  parse  and output clean datasets at the individual play  player  game  and season levels.  Using the data outputted by the package  the trio went on to develop reproducible methods for building expected point and win probability models for the NFL. The outputs of these models are included in this dataset and can be accessed using the nflscrapR package. The dataset made available on Kaggle contains all the regular season plays from the 2009-2016 NFL seasons. The dataset has 356 768 rows and 100 columns. Each play is broken down into great detail containing information on: game situation  players involved  results  and advanced metrics such as expected point and win probability values. Detailed information about the dataset can be found at the following web page  along with more NFL data:https://github.com/ryurko/nflscrapR-data. This dataset was compiled by Ron Yurko  Sam Ventura  and myself. Special shout-out to Ron for improving our current expected points and win probability models and compiling this dataset. All three of us are proud founders of theCarnegie Mellon Sports Analytics Club. This dataset is meant to both grow and bring together the community of sports analytics by providing clean and easily accessible NFL data that has never been availabe on this scale for free.

Metadata Collaborators Authors Coverage DOI Citation Provenance License Expected Update Frequency Activity Overview Views Downloads Engagement Comments Top Contributors Detail View Related Notebooks Similar Datasets,The Movie Recommendation System is a machine learning-based application that provides personalized movie recommendations to users. It utilizes collaborative filtering techniques to analyze user preferences and similarities among movies to generate accurate and relevant recommendations. The system is built using Python programming language and incorporates popular machine learning libraries such as scikit-learn and pandas. The project utilizes the MovieLens dataset  a widely used dataset in the field of recommender systems  containing movie ratings and metadata. The dataset is preprocessed to create a user-item matrix and to calculate item similarity using cosine similarity. This enables the system to identify movies that are similar to the ones the user has previously enjoyed and recommend them accordingly. The recommendation process involves taking a user's unique identifier as input and generating a list of top-rated movie recommendations specifically tailored to their preferences. The system dynamically adjusts and updates the recommendations as new data becomes available. The Movie Recommendation System is intended for individuals who seek personalized movie suggestions to enhance their movie-watching experience. It can be integrated into various platforms such as streaming services  movie review websites  or personal movie catalog applications.

It captures nuanced feedback about courses and instructor performance through a detailed questionnaire. The data has been widely utilized for educational research  quality assurance  and predictive modeling in higher education. Source:The data was collected as part of student evaluations at Gazi University  a leading institution in Turkey. It reflects the diverse experiences and perceptions of students regarding the academic environment  teaching methods  and course organization. Data Collection:Students responded to a survey featuring 28 course-specific questions  each using a 5-point Likert scale (1 indicating strong disagreement and 5 indicating strong agreement). In addition  the dataset includes five contextual attributes that provide further insights into the educational setting. Instructor Identifier (instr):Indicates the instructor‚Äôs ID with values from {1  2  3}. This allows for comparative analysis between different teaching styles and effectiveness. Course Code (class):A numeric identifier for courses  with values ranging from 1 to 13. This enables users to analyze trends and feedback specific to different courses. Number of Repeats (nb.repeat):Reflects the number of times a student has taken the course. Repeated enrollments can be a proxy for course difficulty or student preference. Attendance (attendance):A coded measure (ranging from 0 to 4) representing the level of class attendance  which can correlate with engagement and overall satisfaction. Difficulty (difficulty):A self-reported measure of the course‚Äôs difficulty  rated on a 5-point scale. This attribute provides context for evaluating student perceptions alongside other measures.

Liver cancer is thefifthmost commonly occurring cancer in men and theninthmost commonly occurring cancer in women. There were over840 000 new cases in 2018. The liver is a common site of primary or secondary tumor development. Due to their heterogeneous and diffusive shape  automatic segmentation of tumor lesions is very challenging. In light of that  we encourage the development of automatic segmentation algorithms to segment liver lesions in contrast¬≠-enhanced abdominal CT scans. The data and segmentations are provided by various clinical sites around the world.This dataset was extracted from LiTS ‚Äì Liver Tumor Segmentation Challenge (LiTS17) organised in conjunction with ISBI 2017 and MICCAI 2017.

I recently found out that Atari hadportedthe classic game for iOS  and I immediately purchased it. Now I play whenever I get a free moment. Usually I manage to play a few games a week while I watch TV or listen to podcasts. If you do not know  a main aspect of the game involves designing custom roller coasters. When you build something new  you can go to a special window to view the ride statistics: The most important metrics are at the top: You want to maximize excitement without making the ride too intense or nauseating. When I was a kid I had no patience for numbers (I created rides for maximumawesomeness)  but these days I'm fond of that sort of thing. After I completed a few park scenarios  I began to wonder If i can use my own data to build better roller coasters. So I started saving my ride stats in a spreadsheet: After completing each scenario  I just logged the stats from each ride into the spreadsheet. This repository contains that data  as well as any analyses I might conduct on it. I still play a few games a week (duh)  so occasionally I will update the database with my future creations (feel free to send me your own!). Each ride is cataloged based on the info from the window above:

The current dissemination covers the period 1961‚Äì2023. Statistics are available for monthly  seasonal and annual mean temperature anomalies  i.e.  temperature change with respect to a baseline climatology  corresponding to the period 1951‚Äì1980. The standard deviation of the temperature change of the baseline methodology is also available. Data are based on the publicly available GISTEMP data  the Global Surface Temperature Change data distributed by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration Goddard Institute for Space Studies (NASA-GISS). Statistical concepts and definitions Statistical standards: Data in the Temperature Change domain are not an explicit SEEA variable. Nonetheless  country and regional calculations employ a definition of ‚ÄúLand area‚Äù consistent with SEEA Land Use definitions  specifically SEEA CF Table 5.11 ‚ÄúLand Use Classification‚Äù and SEEA AFF Table 4.8  ‚ÄúPhysical asset account for land use.‚Äù The Temperature Change domain of the FAOSTAT Agri-Environmental Indicators section is compliant with the Framework for the Development of Environmental Statistics (FDES 2013)  contributing to FDES Component 1: Environmental Conditions and Quality  Sub-component 1.1: Physical Conditions  Topic 1.1.1: Atmosphere  climate and weather  Core set/ Tier 1 statistics a.1.

The best proof of this situation is the historical temperature change.  You can investigate if any hope there is for stopping global warming  :) Can you find any correlation between temperature change and any other variable?(Using ISO3 codes for merging any other countries' data sets possible.) Prediction of temperature change: there is also an overall world temperature change in the country list as 'World'.

The Iris flower data set or Fisher's Iris data set is a multivariate data set introduced by the British statistician and biologist Ronald Fisher in his 1936 paper The use of multiple measurements in taxonomic problems as an example of linear discriminant analysis.[1] It is sometimes called Anderson's Iris data set because Edgar Anderson collected the data to quantify the morphologic variation of Iris flowers of three related species.[2] Two of the three species were collected in the Gasp√© Peninsula ""all from the same pasture  and picked on the same day and measured at the same time by the same person with the same apparatus"".[3] The data set consists of 50 samples from each of three species of Iris (Iris setosa  Iris virginica and Iris versicolor). Four features were measured from each sample: the length and the width of the sepals and petals  in centimetres. Based on the combination of these four features  Fisher developed a linear discriminant model to distinguish the species from each other. description taken from WikiWould like to thank Dr. Jason Brownlee who has explained all the examples very nicely and clearly!"

From the pioneering efforts of the 19th century to the transformative breakthroughs of the 21st century  EVs have continually evolved  driven by technological advancements  environmental considerations  and shifting market dynamics. I also examine the various types of electric vehicles currently available  including Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs)  Fuel Cell Electric Vehicles (FCEVs)  and Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs). Each of these powertrains offers unique advantages and challenges  reflecting the diverse needs and preferences of today‚Äôs drivers. Through data visualisations and  analysis  I present a snapshot of global EV trends  showcasing the growth of EV sales and the distribution of different powertrain types across regions. As we look towards the future  the Global EV Outlook underscores the potential of electric mobility to reshape the transportation landscape and drive us toward a more sustainable and innovative future. The history of electric vehicles (EVs) is rich and varied  spanning well over a century of innovation  decline  and resurgence. Let's look at the evolution of EVs  focusing on their early history  the oil crisis of the 1970s  and notable vehicles like the Sinclair C5. Late 19th Century - Early 20th Century: Sinclair C5 (1985): Other Notable Early EVs Modern Resurgence The history of electric vehicles spans from early innovations in the 19th century to a significant resurgence in the 21st century. The market share of electric vehicles was notably high in the early 1900s but declined with the rise of gasoline-powered cars. The 1970s oil crisis sparked renewed interest in EVs  leading to various experimental models. Notable early electric vehicles  such as the Sinclair C5 and GM EV1  paved the way for the modern electric vehicle revolution. Today  electric vehicles are at the forefront of automotive technology  with continued advancements and growing adoption worldwide. The three main types of electric vehicle (EV) powertrains: Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs)  Fuel Cell Electric Vehicles (FCEVs)  and Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs). Each of these powertrains has distinct characteristics  advantages  and limitations. Definition: Key Features: Examples: Advantages: Limitations: Definition: Key Features: Examples: Advantages: Limitations: Definition: Key Features: Examples: Advantages: Limitations: Each type of powertrain has its strengths and fits different use cases and user needs. The choice among them often depends on factors like driving habits  availability of refuelling or charging infrastructure  and environmental goals. BEVs are battery electric vehicles. PHEVs are plug-in hybrid electric vehicles. FCEVs are fuel cell electric vehicles. EVs refers to all electric vehicles (BEVs + PHEVs). A Markdown document with the R code for the above multi-plot.link ""EV Sales Over Time by Grouped Region"": ""EV Sales Share by Grouped Region and BEV Powertrain"": ""Worldwide Distribution of EV Sales by Powertrain Type"": I firmly believe that electric vehicles (EVs) are here to stay  and I offer several reasons to support this assertion: Reduced Emissions:EVs produce zero exhaust/tailpipe emissions  contributing significantly to the reduction of air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions. This is crucial for addressing climate change and improving air quality. Battery Technology:Continuous improvements in battery technology are increasing the range  reducing the charging time  and lowering the cost of EVs. Innovations such as solid-state batteries promise even greater advancements.link Lower Operating Costs:EVs generally have lower operating and maintenance costs compared to internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles. Electricity is cheaper than petrol  and EVs have fewer moving parts  leading to less wear and tear. Regulatory Support:Governments worldwide are implementing policies to promote EV adoption  including subsidies  tax incentives  and stringent emission regulations for ICE vehicles. Some countries and cities are setting deadlines to phase out ICE vehicles entirely. Automaker Commitments:Major automotive manufacturers are investing heavily in EV development and are planning to electrify their fleets. Companies like Tesla  Nissan  General Motors  and Volkswagen are leading the charge. Charging Network Expansion:The expansion of charging infrastructure  including fast-charging networks  is making EV ownership more convenient and practical.Tracking the growth in charging points across the UK:link Growing Popularity:Consumer awareness and demand for sustainable transportation options are increasing. More people are becoming environmentally conscious and are choosing EVs as a viable alternative to traditional vehicles. Urbanisation and Mobility Trends:With the rise of urbanisation  shared mobility  and smart city initiatives  EVs are becoming integral to modern urban transport systems. Electric buses  bikes  and scooters are also gaining popularity. Resource Efficiency:EVs are seen as part of a broader transition to a more sustainable and energy-efficient transportation system  aligning with global sustainability goals. Considering these factors  the momentum behind EVs suggests they are not a passing trend but a significant and lasting shift in the automotive industry and global transportation. The narrative of electric vehicles is one of transformation and resilience. From the early 20th century  when EVs held a significant market share  to their near-disappearance with the rise of petrol engines  the journey of electric vehicles is marked by both challenges and breakthroughs. The oil crises of the 1970s brought a renewed focus on alternative energy sources  setting the stage for modern electric vehicles. Innovations such as the Sinclair C5 and the GM EV1 were pivotal in shaping the current landscape. Today  with advancements in battery technology and increasing environmental awareness  electric vehicles are at the forefront of automotive innovation. As we continue to develop and embrace these technologies  the evolution of electric vehicles highlights their potential to reshape the future of transportation. Patrick Ford üîå"

With RS images becoming more accessible than ever before  there is an increasing demand for the automatic interpretation of these images. In this context  the benchmark datasets serve as essential prerequisites for developing and testing intelligent interpretation algorithms. After reviewing existing benchmark datasets in the research community of RS image interpretation  this article discusses the problem of how to efficiently prepare a suitable benchmark dataset for RS image interpretation. Specifically  we first analyze the current challenges of developing intelligent algorithms for RS image interpretation with bibliometric investigations. We then present the general guidance on creating benchmark datasets in efficient manners. Following the presented guidance  we also provide an example on building RS image dataset  i.e.  Million-AID  a new large-scale benchmark dataset containing a million instances for RS image scene classification. Several challenges and perspectives in RS image annotation are finally discussed to facilitate the research in benchmark dataset construction. We do hope this paper will provide the RS community an overall perspective on constructing large-scale and practical image datasets for further research  especially data-driven ones. Annotated Datasets for RS Image InterpretationThe interpretation of RS images has been playing an increasingly important role in a large diversity of applications  and thus  has attracted remarkable research attentions. Consequently  various datasets have been built to advance the development of interpretation algorithms for RS images. Covering literature published over the past decade  we perform a systematic review of the existing RS image datasets concerning the current mainstream of RS image interpretation tasks  including scene classification  object detection  semantic segmentation and change detection.

Bohanec and V. Rajkovic: Knowledge acquisition and explanation formulti-attribute decision making. In 8th Intl Workshop on ExpertSystems and their Applications  Avignon  France. pages 59-78  1988. Within machine-learning  this dataset was used for the evaluationof HINT (Hierarchy INduction Tool)  which was proved to be able tocompletely reconstruct the original hierarchical model. This together with a comparison with C4.5  is presented in B. Zupan  M. Bohanec  I. Bratko  J. Demsar: Machine learning byfunction decomposition. ICML-97  Nashville  TN. 1997 (to appear) Relevant Information Paragraph: Car Evaluation Database was derived from a simple hierarchicaldecision model originally developed for the demonstration of DEX(M. Bohanec  V. Rajkovic: Expert system for decisionmaking. Sistemica 1(1)  pp. 145-157  1990.). The model evaluatescars according to the following concept structure: CAR                      car acceptability. PRICE                  overall price. . buying               buying price. . maint                price of the maintenance. TECH                   technical characteristics. .

Besides the targetconcept (CAR)  the model includes three intermediate concepts:PRICE  TECH  COMFORT. Every concept is in the original modelrelated to its lower level descendants by a set of examples (forthese examples sets seehttp://www-ai.ijs.si/BlazZupan/car.html). The Car Evaluation Database contains examples with the structuralinformation removed  i.e.  directly relates CAR to the six inputattributes: buying  maint  doors  persons  lug_boot  safety. Because of known underlying concept structure  this database may beparticularly useful for testing constructive induction andstructure discovery methods.

How would you describe this dataset? Metadata Collaborators Authors Coverage DOI Citation Provenance License Expected Update Frequency Activity Overview Views Downloads Engagement Comments Top Contributors Detail View Related Notebooks Similar Datasets,"CONTEXT ======================================== ======================================== Money laundering is a multi-billion dollar issue.  Detection of laundering is very difficult.  Most automated algorithms have a high false positive rate: legitimate transactions incorrectly flagged as laundering.  The converse is also a major problem -- false negatives  i.e. undetected laundering transactions.  Naturally  criminals work hard to cover their tracks. Access to real financial transaction data is highly restricted -- for both proprietary and privacy reasons.  Even when access is possible  it is problematic to provide a correct tag (laundering or legitimate) to each transaction -- as noted above.  Thissynthetic transaction datafrom IBM avoids these problems. The data provided here is based on a virtual world inhabited by individuals  companies  and banks.  Individuals interact with other individuals and companies.  Likewise  companies interact with other companies and with individuals.  These interactions can take many forms  e.g. purchase of consumer goods and services  purchase orders for industrial supplies  payment of salaries  repayment of loans  and more.  These financial transactions are generally conducted via banks  i.e. the payer and receiver both have accounts  with accounts taking multiple forms from checking to credit cards to bitcoin. Some (small) fraction of the individuals and companies in the generator model engage in criminal behavior -- such as smuggling  illegal gambling  extortion  and more.  Criminals obtain funds from these illicit activities  and then try to hide the source of these illicit funds via a series of financial transactions.  Such financial transactions to hide illicit funds constitute laundering.  Thus  the data available here is labelled and can be used for training and testing AML (Anti Money Laundering) models and for other purposes. The data generator that created the data here not only models illicit activity  but also tracks funds derived from illicit activity through arbitrarily many transactions -- thus creating the ability to label laundering transactions many steps removed from their illicit source.  With this foundation  it is straightforward for the generator to label individual transactions as laundering or legitimate. Note that this IBM generator models the entire money laundering cycle: As another capability possible only with synthetic data  note that a real bank or other institution typically has access to only a portion of the transactions involved in laundering:  the transactions involving that bank.  Transactions happening at other banks or between other banks are not seen.  Thus  models built on real transactions from one institution can have only a limited view of the world. By contrast these synthetic transactions contain an entire financial ecosystem.  Thus it may be possible to create laundering detection models that undertand the broad sweep of transactions across institutions  but apply those models to make inferences only about transactions at a particular bank. As another point of reference  IBM previously released data from a very early version of this data generator:https://ibm.box.com/v/AML-Anti-Money-Laundering-Data The generator has been made significantly more robust since that previous data was released  and these transactions reflect improved realism  bug fixes  and other improvements compared to the previous release. Credit card transaction data labeled for fraud and built using a related generator is also available on Kaggle:https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ealtman2019/credit-card-transactions CONTENT We release 6 datasets here divided into two groups of three: Both HI and LI internally have three sets of data:  small  medium  and large.  The goal is to support a broad degree of modeling and computational resources.  All of these datasets are independent  e.g. the small datasets are not a subset of the medium datasets.  However  each of the six individual datasets can be subset chronologically for train  validate  and test.  we have found a 60% / 20% / 20% division to be effective  and encourage others to follow this division. This table has some additional statistics about the six datasets: ```Note that the ""Date Range"" provided is ""primary"" period of transaction activity.  Inthe discussionMarco Pianta observed that there are some transactions after the specified date period  and that those transactions are all laundering.  Please see the response to Marco for a fuller description of this situation and how to deal with it.We thank Marco for raising this issue. Finally  we provide two files for each of the six datasets: A. A list of transactions in CSV format B. A text file list of laundering transactions following one of 8 particular patterns introduced by Suzumura and Kanezashi in theirAMLSim simulator. We note that not all laundering in the data follows one of these 8 patterns.  As with other aspects of this data noted above  knowing all the transcation involved in particular laundering patterns is an immense challenge with real data.

A term deposit is a cash investment held at a financial institution. Your money is invested for an agreed rate of interest over a fixed amount of time  or term. The bank has various outreach plans to sell term deposits to their customers such as email marketing  advertisements  telephonic marketing  and digital marketing. Telephonic marketing campaigns still remain one of the most effective way to reach out to people. However  they require huge investment as large call centers are hired to actually execute these campaigns. Hence  it is crucial to identify the customers most likely to convert beforehand so that they can be specifically targeted via call. The data is related to direct marketing campaigns (phone calls) of a Portuguese banking institution. The classification goal is to predict if the client will subscribe to a term deposit (variable y). The data is related to the direct marketing campaigns of a Portuguese banking institution. The marketing campaigns were based on phone calls. Often  more than one contact to the same client was required  in order to access if the product (bank term deposit) would be ('yes') or not ('no') subscribed by the customer or not.

Due to the wide variety in kidney and kidney tumor morphology  there is currently great interest in how tumor morphology relates to surgical outcomes   as well as in developing advanced surgical planning techniques. Automatic semantic segmentation is a promising tool for these efforts  but morphological heterogeneity makes it a difficult problem. The goal of this challenge is to accelerate the development of reliable kidney and kidney tumor semantic segmentation methodologies. We have produced ground truth semantic segmentations for arterial phase abdominal CT scans of 300 unique kidney cancer patients who underwent partial or radical nephrectomy at our institution. 210 of these have been released for model training and validation  and the remaining 90 will be held out for objective model evaluation (see the detailed data description). https://kits19.grand-challenge.org/ References ‚ÄúKidney Cancer Statistics.‚Äù World Cancer Research Fund  12 Sept. 2018 www.wcrf.org/dietandcancer/cancer-trends/kidney-cancer-statistics. ‚ÄúCancer Diagnosis and Treatment Statistics.‚Äù Stages | Mesothelioma | Cancer Research UK  26 Oct. 2017 www.cancerresearchuk.org/health-professional/cancer-statistics/diagnosis-and-treatment.

The dataset can be used to train classifiers to detect synthetic speech. The dataset aggregates data from the latest TTS solutions (such asDeep Voice 3andGoogle Wavenet TTS) as well as a variety of real human speech  including theArctic Dataset(http://festvox.org/cmu_arctic/) LJSpeech Dataset(https://keithito.com/LJ-Speech-Dataset/) VoxForge Dataset(http://www.voxforge.org) and our own speech recordings. The dataset is published in four versions:for-original for-norm for-2secandfor-rerec. The first version  namedfor-original  contains the files as collected from the speech sources  without any modification (balanced version). The second version  calledfor-norm  contains the same files  but  balanced in terms of gender and class and normalized in terms of sample rate  volume and number of channels. The third one  namedfor-2secis based on the second one  but with the files truncated at 2 seconds. The last version  namedfor-rerec  is a rerecorded version of the for-2second dataset  to simulate a scenario where an attacker sends an utterance through a voice channel (i.e. a phone call or a voice message).

The league was founded by the Board of Control for Cricket in India(BCCI) in 2008. I am not the greatest cricket fan out there but I enjoy cricket as much as the next guy.Although I am a huge fan of Aaron Sorkin and his work.If you are a fan of him like me you must be knowing what movie I am inspiring this fromMoneyball(2011) I was awestruck by such exclamations of formation of a best team with the help of some numbers on a sheet that might determine the players abilities.This sounded absolutely preposterous to me but with a little bit of cynicism I continued my research. I was dumbfounded when I had found such determinations were possible and people were using such determinations to create fantasy teams on various sports and leagues. PECOTA  an acronym for Player Empirical Comparison and Optimization Test Algorithm  is such a sabermetric system for forecasting Major League Baseball player performance. The word is a backronym based on the name of journeyman major league player Bill Pecota  who  with a lifetime batting average of .249  is perhaps representative of the typical PECOTA entry. PECOTA was developed by Nate Silver in 2002‚Äì2003 and introduced to the public in the book Baseball Prospectus 2003. Baseball Prospectus (BP) has owned PECOTA since 2003; Silver managed PECOTA from 2003 to 2009. Beginning in Spring 2009  BP assumed responsibility for producing the annual forecasts  making 2010 the first baseball season for which Silver played no role in producing PECOTA projections. One of several widely publicized statistical systems of forecasts of player performance  PECOTA player forecasts are marketed by BP as a fantasy baseball product. Since 2003  annual PECOTA forecasts have been published both in the Baseball Prospectus annual books and  in more detailed form  on the BaseballProspectus.com subscription-based website. PECOTA also inspired some analogous projection systems for other professional sports: KUBIAK for the National Football League  SCHOENE and CARMELO for the National Basketball Association  and VUKOTA for the National Hockey League. PECOTA forecasts a player's performance in all of the major categories used in typical fantasy baseball games; it also forecasts production in advanced sabermetric categories developed by Baseball Prospectus (e.g.  VORP and EqA). In addition  PECOTA forecasts several summary diagnostics such as breakout rates  improve rates  and attrition rates  as well as the market values of the players. The logic and methodology underlying PECOTA have been described in several publications  but the detailed formulas are proprietary and have not been shared with the baseball research community. We need such a public system for cricket to forecast the fantasy leagues that are popping up. As a data science student and enthusiast I tried finding such projects whether existed on kaggle or even the data sets that needed for such projects on IPL.I found no updated data.As the new season of IPL is upon us I wanted to create a data set repository on which such determinations can be made.As I am new to kaggle please guide me so that we can make this possible.I will try to update the data as soon as possible. Lets make this happen. For further data insights please visithere

The classification scheme of galaxies  quasars  and stars is one of the most fundamental in astronomy. The early cataloguing of stars and their distribution in the sky has led to the understanding that they make up our own galaxy and  following the distinction that Andromeda was a separate galaxy to our own  numerous galaxies began to be surveyed as more powerful telescopes were built. This datasat aims to classificate stars  galaxies  and quasars based on their spectral characteristics.

Metadata Collaborators Authors Coverage DOI Citation Provenance License Expected Update Frequency Activity Overview Views Downloads Engagement Comments Top Contributors Detail View Related Notebooks Similar Datasets,Historically  gold had been used as a form of currency in various parts of the world including the USA. In present times  precious metals like gold are held with central banks of all countries to guarantee re-payment of foreign debts  and also to control inflation which results in reflecting the financial strength of the country. Recently  emerging world economies  such as China  Russia  and India have been big buyers of gold  whereas the USA  SoUSA  South Africa  and Australia are among the big seller of gold. Forecasting rise and fall in the daily gold rates can help investors to decide when to buy (or sell) the commodity. But Gold prices are dependent on many factors such as prices of other precious metals  prices of crude oil  stock exchange performance  Bonds prices  currency exchange rates  etc. The challenge of this project is to accurately predict the future adjusted closing price of Gold ETF across a given period of time in the future. The problem is a regression problem  because the output value which is the adjusted closing price in this project is continuous value. Data for this study is collected from November 18th 2011 to January 1st 2019 from various sources. The data has 1718 rows in total and 80 columns in total. Data for attributes  such as Oil Price  Standard and Poor‚Äôs (S&P) 500 index  Dow Jones Index US Bond rates (10 years)  Euro USD exchange rates  prices of precious metals Silver and Platinum and other metals such as Palladium and Rhodium  prices of US Dollar Index  Eldorado Gold Corporation and Gold Miners ETF were gathered. The dataset has 1718 rows in total and 80 columns in total. Data for attributes  such as Oil Price  Standard and Poor‚Äôs (S&P) 500 index  Dow Jones Index US Bond rates (10 years)  Euro USD exchange rates  prices of precious metals Silver and Platinum and other metals such as Palladium and Rhodium  prices of US Dollar Index  Eldorado Gold Corporation and Gold Miners ETF were gathered. The historical data of Gold ETF fetched from Yahoo finance has 7 columns  Date  Open  High  Low  Close  Adjusted Close  and Volume  the difference between Adjusted Close and Close is that the closing price of a stock is the price of that stock at the close of the trading day. Whereas the adjusted closing price takes into account factors such as dividends  stock splits  and new stock offerings to determine a value. So  Adjusted Close is the outcome variable which is the value you have to predict. The data is collected from Yahoo finance. Can you predict Gold prices accurately using traditional machine learning algorithms

The database was first published in [1] at the ICDAR 1999. Using this database an HMM based recognition system for handwritten sentences was developed and published in [2] at the ICPR 2000. The segmentation scheme used in the second version of the database is documented in [3] and has been published in the ICPR 2002. The IAM-database as of October 2002 is described in [4]. We use the database extensively in our own research  see publications for further details. The database contains forms of unconstrained handwritten text  which were scanned at a resolution of 300dpi and saved as PNG images with 256 gray levels. The figure below provides samples of a complete form  a text line and some extracted words. Characteristics The IAM Handwriting Database 3.0 is structured as follows: 657 writers contributed samples of their handwriting1'539 pages of scanned text5'685 isolated and labeled sentences13'353 isolated and labeled text lines115'320 isolated and labeled wordsThe words have been extracted from pages of scanned text using an automatic segmentation scheme and were verified manually. The segmentation scheme has been developed at our institute [3]. All form  line and word images are provided as PNG files and the corresponding form label files  including segmentation information and variety of estimated parameters (from the preprocessing steps described in [2])  are included in the image files as meta-information in XML format which is described in XML file and XML file format (DTD).

An insurance policy is an arrangement by which a company undertakes to provide a guarantee of compensation for specified loss  damage  illness  or death in return for the payment of a specified premium. A premium is a sum of money that the customer needs to pay regularly to an insurance company for this guarantee. For example  you may pay a premium of Rs. 5000 each year for a health insurance cover of Rs. 200 000/- so that if  God forbid  you fall ill and need to be hospitalised in that year  the insurance provider company will bear the cost of hospitalisation etc. for upto Rs. 200 000. Now if you are wondering how can company bear such high hospitalisation cost when it charges a premium of only Rs. 5000/-  that is where the concept of probabilities comes in picture. For example  like you  there may be 100 customers who would be paying a premium of Rs. 5000 every year  but only a few of them (say 2-3) would get hospitalised that year and not everyone. This way everyone shares the risk of everyone else. Just like medical insurance  there is vehicle insurance where every year customer needs to pay a premium of certain amount to insurance provider company so that in case of unfortunate accident by the vehicle  the insurance provider company will provide a compensation (called ‚Äòsum assured‚Äô) to the customer. Building a model to predict whether a customer would be interested in Vehicle Insurance is extremely helpful for the company because it can then accordingly plan its communication strategy to reach out to those customers and optimise its business model and revenue. Now  in order to predict  whether the customer would be interested in Vehicle insurance  you have information about demographics (gender  age  region code type)  Vehicles (Vehicle Age  Damage)  Policy (Premium  sourcing channel) etc. The evaluation metric for this hackathon is ROC_AUC score. The public leaderboard is based on 40% of test data  while final rank would be decided on remaining 60% of test data (which is private leaderboard) Please ensure that your final submission includes the following:

The data was collected in November  2022  and contains nearly all Twitter accounts active at that time. The records are in numerical order by ID. Each of the 288 files has exactly 10 million entries (except the last file). The .csv files have just 2 columns: ID and screenname. Twitter IDs and screennames are unique. The ID is permanent and cannot be changed. The screenname can be changed  but only to a screenname that nobody else has. Because of this  there are a small amount of duplicate screennames in the dataset. Screennames are case insensitive. Nearly all screennames only contain the letters a-z  digits 0-9  and/or underscore(s). Since the IDs are unique  there are no duplicate IDs. The IDs are 64-bit signed integers (although none are negative). Early IDs were issued sequentially  but around February  2016 Twitter started using Snowflake IDs (unused sign bit  41 bits timestamp  10 bit machine ID  12 bit sequence).

This data approach student achievement in secondary education of two Portuguese schools. The data attributes include student grades  demographic  social and school related features) and it was collected by using school reports and questionnaires. Two datasets are provided regarding the performance in two distinct subjects: Mathematics (mat) and Portuguese language (por). In [Cortez and Silva  2008]  the two datasets were modeled under binary/five-level classification and regression tasks. Important note: the target attribute G3 has a strong correlation with attributes G2 and G1. This occurs because G3 is the final year grade (issued at the 3rd period)  while G1 and G2 correspond to the 1st and 2nd-period grades. It is more difficult to predict G3 without G2 and G1  but such prediction is much more useful (see paper source for more details).

How would you describe this dataset? Metadata Collaborators Authors Coverage DOI Citation Provenance License Expected Update Frequency Activity Overview Views Downloads Engagement Comments Top Contributors Detail View Related Notebooks Similar Datasets","A stroke is a medical condition in which poor blood flow to the brain causes cell death. There are two main types of stroke: ischemic  due to lack of blood flow  and hemorrhagic  due to bleeding. Both cause parts of the brain to stop functioning properly. Signs and symptoms of a stroke may include an inability to move or feel on one side of the body  problems understanding or speaking  dizziness  or loss of vision to one side. Signs and symptoms often appear soon after the stroke has occurred. If symptoms last less than one or two hours  the stroke is a transient ischemic attack (TIA)  also called a mini-stroke. A hemorrhagic stroke may also be associated with a severe headache. The symptoms of a stroke can be permanent. Long-term complications may include pneumonia and loss of bladder control. The main risk factor for stroke is high blood pressure. Other risk factors include high blood cholesterol  tobacco smoking  obesity  diabetes mellitus  a previous TIA  end-stage kidney disease  and atrial fibrillation. An ischemic stroke is typically caused by blockage of a blood vessel  though there are also less common causes. A hemorrhagic stroke is caused by either bleeding directly into the brain or into the space between the brain's membranes. Bleeding may occur due to a ruptured brain aneurysm. Diagnosis is typically based on a physical exam and is supported by medical imaging such as a CT scan or MRI scan. A CT scan can rule out bleeding  but may not necessarily rule out ischemia  which early on typically does not show up on a CT scan. Other tests such as an electrocardiogram (ECG) and blood tests are done to determine risk factors and rule out other possible causes. Low blood sugar may cause similar symptoms. Prevention includes decreasing risk factors  surgery to open up the arteries to the brain in those with problematic carotid narrowing  and warfarin in people with atrial fibrillation. Aspirin or statins may be recommended by physicians for prevention. A stroke or TIA often requires emergency care. An ischemic stroke  if detected within three to four and half hours  may be treatable with a medication that can break down the clot. Some hemorrhagic strokes benefit from surgery. Treatment to attempt recovery of lost function is called stroke rehabilitation  and ideally takes place in a stroke unit; however  these are not available in much of the world. 1) gender: ""Male""  ""Female"" or ""Other"" 2) age: age of the patient 3) hypertension: 0 if the patient doesn't have hypertension  1 if the patient has hypertension 4) heart disease: 0 if the patient doesn't have any heart diseases  1 if the patient has a heart disease 5) Ever-married: ""No"" or ""Yes"" 6) work type: ""children""  ""Govtjov""  ""Never worked""  ""Private"" or ""Self-employed"" 7) Residencetype: ""Rural"" or ""Urban"" 8) avg glucose level: average glucose level in blood 9) BMI: body mass index 10) smoking_status: ""formerly smoked""  ""never smoked""  ""smokes"" or ""Unknown""* 11) stroke: 1 if the patient had a stroke or 0 if not"

[TBD] This data would not be available without the full collaboration from our customers who understand that sharing their core and strategical information has more advantages than possible hazards. They also support our continuos development of innovative ML systems across their value chain. Every retail business in the world faces a fundamental question: how much inventory should I carry? In one hand to mush inventory means working capital costs  operational costs and a complex operation. On the other hand lack of inventory leads to lost sales  unhappy customers and a damaged brand. Current inventory management models have many solutions to place the correct order  but they are all based in a single unknown factor: the demand for the next periods. This is why short-term forecasting is so important in retail and consumer goods industry. We encourage you to seek for the best demand forecasting model for the next 2-3 weeks. This valuable insight can help many supply chain practitioners to correctly manage their inventory levels.

We present a residual learning framework to ease the training of networks that are substantially deeper than those used previously. We explicitly reformulate the layers as learning residual functions with reference to the layer inputs  instead of learning unreferenced functions. We provide comprehensive empirical evidence showing that these residual networks are easier to optimize  and can gain accuracy from considerably increased depth. On the ImageNet dataset we evaluate residual nets with a depth of up to 152 layers---8x deeper than VGG nets but still having lower complexity. An ensemble of these residual nets achieves 3.57% error on the ImageNet test set. This result won the 1st place on the ILSVRC 2015 classification task. We also present analysis on CIFAR-10 with 100 and 1000 layers. The depth of representations is of central importance for many visual recognition tasks. Solely due to our extremely deep representations  we obtain a 28% relative improvement on the COCO object detection dataset. Deep residual nets are foundations of our submissions to ILSVRC & COCO 2015 competitions  where we also won the 1st places on the tasks of ImageNet detection  ImageNet localization  COCO detection  and COCO segmentation.

Learned features are often transferable to different data. For example  a model trained on a large dataset of bird images will contain learned features like edges or horizontal lines that you would be transferable your dataset. Pre-trained models are beneficial to us for many reasons. By using a pre-trained model you are saving time. Someone else has already spent the time and compute resources to learn a lot of features and your model will likely benefit from it.

In natural language processing  very frequent words tend to be less informative than less frequent one and are often removed during preprocessing. Human language users are also sensitive to  word frequency. How often a word is used affects language processing in humans. For example very frequent words are read and understood more quicklyand can beunderstood more easily in background noise. This dataset contains the counts of the 333 333 most commonly-used single words on the English language web  as derived from the Google Web Trillion Word Corpus. Data files were derived from the Google Web Trillion Word Corpus (asdescribedby Thorsten Brants and Alex Franz  anddistributedby the Linguistic Data Consortium) by Peter Norvig.

Approximately 30 million OCT scans are performed each year  and the analysis and interpretation of these images takes up a significant amount of time (Swanson and Fujimoto  2017). Figure 2. Representative Optical Coherence Tomography Images and the Workflow Diagram [Kermany et. al. 2018]http://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(18)30154-5 (A) (Far left) choroidal neovascularization (CNV) with neovascular membrane (white arrowheads) and associated subretinal fluid (arrows). (Middle left) Diabetic macular edema (DME) with retinal-thickening-associated intraretinal fluid (arrows). (Middle right) Multiple drusen (arrowheads) present in early AMD. (Far right) Normal retina with preserved foveal contour and absence of any retinal fluid/edema. The dataset is organized into 3 folders (train  test  val) and contains subfolders for each image category (NORMAL CNV DME DRUSEN). There are 84 495 X-Ray images (JPEG) and 4 categories (NORMAL CNV DME DRUSEN). Images are labeled as (disease)-(randomized patient ID)-(image number by this patient) and split into 4 directories: CNV  DME  DRUSEN  and NORMAL. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) images (Spectralis OCT  Heidelberg Engineering  Germany) were selected from retrospective cohorts of adult patients from the Shiley Eye Institute of the University of California San Diego  the California Retinal Research Foundation  Medical Center Ophthalmology Associates  the Shanghai First People‚Äôs Hospital  and Beijing Tongren Eye Center between July 1  2013 and March 1  2017. Before training  each image went through a tiered grading system consisting of multiple layers of trained graders of increasing exper- tise for verification and correction of image labels. Each image imported into the database started with a label matching the most recent diagnosis of the patient. The first tier of graders consisted of undergraduate and medical students who had taken and passed an OCT interpretation course review. This first tier of graders conducted initial quality control and excluded OCT images containing severe artifacts or significant image resolution reductions. The second tier of graders consisted of four ophthalmologists who independently graded each image that had passed the first tier. The presence or absence of choroidal neovascularization (active or in the form of subretinal fibrosis)  macular edema  drusen  and other pathologies visible on the OCT scan were recorded. Finally  a third tier of two senior independent retinal specialists  each with over 20 years of clinical retina experience  verified the true labels for each image. The dataset selection and stratification process is displayed in a CONSORT-style diagram in Figure 2B. To account for human error in grading  a validation subset of 993 scans was graded separately by two ophthalmologist graders  with disagreement in clinical labels arbitrated by a senior retinal specialist.

Summarize categorical variables (e.g.  Gender  Loyalty Level  Purchase History) with frequency distributions and percentages. Two-Sample t-Test (Independent t-test): Compare the mean satisfaction scores between two independent groups (e.g.  Group A vs. Group B) to determine if there is a significant difference in their average satisfaction scores. Paired t-Test: If there are two related measurements (e.g.  satisfaction scores before and after a certain event)  you can compare the means using a paired t-test. One-Way ANOVA (Analysis of Variance): Test if there are significant differences in mean satisfaction scores across more than two groups (e.g.  comparing the mean satisfaction score across different Loyalty Levels). Chi-Square Test for Independence: Examine the relationship between two categorical variables (e.g.  Gender vs. Purchase History or Loyalty Level vs. Support Contacted) to determine if there‚Äôs a significant association. Mann-Whitney U Test: For non-normally distributed data  use this test to compare satisfaction scores between two independent groups (e.g.  Group A vs. Group B) to see if their distributions differ significantly. Kruskal-Wallis Test: Similar to ANOVA  but used for non-normally distributed data. This test can compare the median satisfaction scores across multiple groups (e.g.  comparing satisfaction scores across Loyalty Levels or Satisfaction Factors). Spearman‚Äôs Rank Correlation: Test for a monotonic relationship between two ordinal or continuous variables (e.g.  Age vs. Satisfaction Score or Satisfaction Score vs. Loyalty Level). Regression Analysis: Linear Regression: Model the relationship between a continuous dependent variable (e.g.  Satisfaction Score) and independent variables (e.g.  Age  Gender  Loyalty Level). Logistic Regression: If analyzing binary outcomes (e.g.  Purchase History or Support Contacted)  you could model the probability of an outcome based on predictors. Factor Analysis: To identify underlying patterns or groups in customer behavior or satisfaction factors  you can apply Factor Analysis to reduce the dimensionality of the dataset and group similar variables. Cluster Analysis: Use K-Means Clustering or Hierarchical Clustering to group customers based on similarity in their satisfaction scores and other features (e.g.  Loyalty Level  Purchase History). Confidence Intervals: Calculate confidence intervals for the mean of satisfaction scores or any other metric to estimate the range in which the true population mean might lie.

Through e-commerce  businesses can get access and establish a wider market presence by providing cheaper and more efficient distribution channels for their products or services. E-commerce has also changed the way people shop and consume products and services. Many people are turning to their computers or smart devices to order goods  which can easily be delivered to their homes. This is a sales transaction data set of UK-based e-commerce (online retail) for one year. This London-based shop has been selling gifts and homewares for adults and children through the website since 2007. Their customers come from all over the world and usually make direct purchases for themselves. There are also small businesses that buy in bulk and sell to other customers through retail outlet channels. The data set contains 500K rows and 8 columns. The following is the description of each column. There is a small percentage of order cancellation in the data set. Most of these cancellations were due to out-of-stock conditions on some products. Under this situation  customers tend to cancel an order as they want all products delivered all at once. Information is a main asset of businesses nowadays. The success of a business in a competitive environment depends on its ability to acquire  store  and utilize information. Data is one of the main sources of information. Therefore  data analysis is an important activity for acquiring new and useful information. Analyze this dataset and try to answer the following questions. Photo byCardMapronUnsplash

Metadata Collaborators Authors Coverage DOI Citation Provenance License Expected Update Frequency Activity Overview Views Downloads Engagement Comments Top Contributors Detail View Related Notebooks Similar Datasets,this graph was created in PowerBi Loocker Studio and Tableau : This dataset provides a comprehensive analysis of the technological landscape in three of China‚Äôs most prominent innovation hubs: Beijing  Shanghai  and Shenzhen. It focuses on invention patents and offers insights into the complexity  technology density  and evolution of patent technologies in each of these cities. Rather than simply counting the number of patents  the dataset explores the depth and breadth of technological knowledge involved  the concentration of innovation in specific fields  and the dynamic changes in focus over time. Technological complexity is a key dimension of the dataset  reflecting how advanced and interdisciplinary a particular patent is. In Beijing  this complexity is largely fueled by prestigious academic institutions and research centers such as Tsinghua University and the Chinese Academy of Sciences. Patents in Beijing often combine science and engineering in highly sophisticated ways  particularly in areas like artificial intelligence  aerospace  and advanced materials. Shanghai presents complexity through its integration of industrial systems and smart technologies. The city‚Äôs innovation is heavily influenced by the automotive  chemical  and semiconductor industries  creating complex patents that serve both commercial and industrial applications. Shenzhen  widely regarded as China‚Äôs Silicon Valley  showcases complexity through rapid  iterative development and the fusion of software  hardware  and telecommunications technologies. Its ecosystem  driven by startups and tech giants alike  results in disruptive  high-impact innovations in electronics  AI  and consumer devices. In terms of technology density  Shenzhen shows a strong concentration in electronics  telecommunications  and integrated circuits. This reflects the dominance of companies like Huawei  Tencent  and DJI  and a culture of product engineering that fuels dense clusters of technological advancement. Shanghai  meanwhile  exhibits a balanced density profile  rooted in traditional sectors like chemical engineering and automotive design while simultaneously expanding into digital finance  green technologies  and industrial IoT. Beijing has a wider spread of technology domains  influenced by national research agendas and policy-driven innovation. While it has dense areas in AI and defense  the city also supports advances in biotechnology  clean energy  and cybersecurity.

It contains a large collection of expertly curated histopathology images. üñºÔ∏è Gastric cancer (GC) remains a leading cause of cancer-related deaths globally. The diverse clinical outcomes are significantly influenced by the complex tumor microenvironment (TME). Analyzing the TME from histological images is crucial for understanding disease progression and improving treatment strategies. This dataset addresses the scarcity of well-annotated histological images of GC by providing a large collection of nearly31 000 histological imagesfrom300 whole slide images  meticulously categorized into8 tissue classesrelevant to the TME. The authors also validated the dataset by demonstrating its utility in training two deep learning models. This dataset serves as a valuable resource for advancing AI-driven research in gastric cancer histopathology. üß† https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-025-04489-9#Sec6 This dataset comprises31 096 non-overlapping images  each with a size of224x224 pixels. These images were extracted fromH&E-stained pathological slidesof human gastric cancer obtained from Harbin Medical University Cancer Hospital. üè• The dataset focuses on thetumor microenvironment (TME)and includes images categorized intoeight distinct tissue types: The tissue categories were initially predicted using annotations from a publicly available colorectal cancer dataset to create tissue heatmaps. Subsequently  experienced pathologists selected300 whole slide imageswith high prediction accuracy.

There are a total of 773 unique diseases and 377 symptoms  with ~246 000 rows. The dataset was artificially generated  preserving Symptom Severity and Disease Occurrence Possibility. Several distinct groups of symptoms might all be indicators of the same disease. There may even be one single symptom contributing to a disease in a row or sample. This is an indicator of a very high correlation between the symptom and that particular disease.A larger number of rows for a particular disease corresponds to its higher probability of occurrence in the real world. Similarly  in a row  if the feature vector has the occurrence of a single symptom  it implies that this symptom has more correlation to classify the disease than any one symptom of a feature vector with multiple symptoms in another sample.

The EEGs were recorded monopolarly using Neurocom EEG 23-channel system (Ukraine  XAI-MEDICA). The silver/silver chloride electrodes were placed on the scalp according to the International 10/20 scheme. All electrodes were referenced to the interconnected ear reference electrodes.A high-pass filter with a 30 Hz cut-off frequency and a power line notch filter (50 Hz) were used. All recordings are artifact-free EEG segments of 60 seconds duration. At the stage of data preprocessing  the Independent Component Analysis (ICA) was used to eliminate the artifacts (eyes  muscle  and cardiac overlapping of the cardiac pulsation). The arithmetic task was the serial subtraction of two numbers. Each trial started with the communication orally 4-digit (minuend) and 2-digit (subtrahend) numbers (e.g. 3141 and 42).

While online platforms such as Reddit's r/SuicideWatch have historically provided spaces for individuals to express suicidal thoughts and seek community support  the advent of large language models (LLMs) introduces a new paradigm-where individuals may begin disclosing ideation to AI systems instead of humans. This study evaluates the capability of LLMs to perform automated suicide risk assessment using the Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS). We assess the zero-shot performance of six models-including Claude  GPT  Mistral  and LLaMA-in classifying posts across a 7-point severity scale (Levels 0-6). Results indicate that Claude and GPT closely align with human annotations  while Mistral achieves the lowest ordinal prediction error. Most models exhibit ordinal sensitivity  with misclassifications typically occurring between adjacent severity levels. We further analyze confusion patterns  misclassification sources  and ethical considerations  underscoring the importance of human oversight  transparency  and cautious deployment.

In the United States alone  heart disease claims roughly 647 000 lives each year ‚Äî making it the leading cause of death. The buildup of plaques inside larger coronary arteries  molecular changes associated with aging  chronic inflammation  high blood pressure  and diabetes are all causes of and risk factors for heart disease. While there are different types of coronary heart disease  the majority of individuals only learn they have the disease following symptoms such as chest pain  a heart attack  or sudden cardiac arrest. This fact highlights theimportance of preventative measures and teststhat can accurately predict heart disease in the population prior to negative outcomes like myocardial infarctions (heart attacks) taking place. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has identified high blood pressure  high blood cholesterol  and smoking as three key risk factors for heart disease. Roughly half of Americans have at least one of these three risk factors. The National Heart  Lung  and Blood Institute highlights a wider array of factors such as Age  Environment and Occupation  Family History and Genetics  Lifestyle Habits  Other Medical Conditions  Race or Ethnicity  and Sex for clinicians to use in diagnosing coronary heart disease. Diagnosis tends to be driven by an initial survey of these common risk factors followed by bloodwork and other tests. The Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) is a health-related telephone survey that is collected annually by the CDC. Each year  the survey collects responses from over 400 000 Americans on health-related risk behaviors  chronic health conditions  and the use of preventative services. It has been conducted every year since 1984. For this project  I downloaded a csv of the dataset available on Kaggle for the year 2015. This original dataset contains responses from 441 455 individuals and has 330 features. These features are either questions directly asked of participants  or calculated variables based on individual participant responses. This dataset contains 253 680 survey responses from cleaned BRFSS 2015 to be used primarily for the binary classification of heart disease. Not that there is strong class imbalance in this dataset. 229 787 respondents do not have/have not had heart disease while 23 893 have had heart disease. The question to be explored is: and It it important to reiterate that I did not create this dataset  it is just a cleaned and consolidated dataset created from the BRFSS 2015 dataset already on Kaggle. That dataset can be foundhereand the notebook I used for the data cleaning can be foundhere. Let's build some predictive models for for heart disease.

It accounts for 25% of all cancer cases and affected over 2.1 Million people in 2015 alone. It starts when cells in the breast begin to grow out of control. These cells usually form tumors that can be seen via X-ray or felt as lumps in the breast area. . . The key challenge against its detection is how to classify tumors into malignant (cancerous) or benign(non-cancerous). We ask you to complete the analysis of classifying these tumors using machine learning (with SVMs) and the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Dataset.

For removing this defective product all industry have their quality inspection department. But the main problem is this inspection process is carried out manually. It is a very time-consuming process and due to human accuracy  this is not 100% accurate. This can because of the rejection of the whole order. So it creates a big loss in the company. We decided to make the inspection process automatic and for this  we need to make deep learning classification model for this problem. These all photos are top view of submersible pump impeller(google search for better understanding).The dataset contains total 7348 image data. These all are the size of (300*300) pixels grey-scaled images. In all images  augmentation already applied. Also uploaded images size of 512x512 grayscale. This data set is without Augmentation. This contains 519 ok_front and 781 def_front impeller images.

The crowd density in the walkways was variable  ranging from sparse to very crowded. In the normal setting  the video contains only pedestrians. Abnormal events are due to either:the circulation of non pedestrian entities in the walkwaysanomalous pedestrian motion patternsCommonly occurring anomalies include bikers  skaters  small carts  and people walking across a walkway or in the grass that surrounds it. A few instances of people in wheelchair were also recorded. All abnormalities are naturally occurring  i.e. they were not staged for the purposes of assembling the dataset. The data was split into 2 subsets  each corresponding to a different scene. The video footage recorded from each scene was split into various clips of around 200 frames.Peds1: clips of groups of people walking towards and away from the camera  and some amount of perspective distortion. Contains 34 training video samples and 36 testing video samples.Peds2: scenes with pedestrian movement parallel to the camera plane. Contains 16 training video samples and 12 testing video samples.For each clip  the ground truth annotation includes a binary flag per frame  indicating whether an anomaly is present at that frame. In addition  a subset of 10 clips for Peds1 and 12 clips for Peds2 are provided with manually generated pixel-level binary masks  which identify the regions containing anomalies. This is intended to enable the evaluation of performance with respect to ability of algorithms to localize anomalies.

Traffic data and analytics company INRIX estimates that traffic congestion cost U.S. commuters $305 billion in 2017 due to wasted fuel  lost time and the increased cost of transporting goods through congested areas. Given the physical and financial limitations around building additional roads  cities must use new strategies and technologies to improve traffic conditions. This dataset contains 48.1k (48120) observations of the number of vehicles each hour in four different junctions:1) DateTime2) Juction3) Vehicles4) ID The sensors on each of these junctions were collecting data at different times  hence you will see traffic data from different time periods. Some of the junctions have provided limited or sparse data requiring thoughtfulness when creating future projections.

Metadata Collaborators Authors Coverage DOI Citation Provenance License Expected Update Frequency Activity Overview Views Downloads Engagement Comments Top Contributors Detail View Related Notebooks Similar Datasets,Can you create a classification model to identify landslides? Landslides  triggered by natural events like heavy rainfall and earthquakes  pose significant risks to lives  infrastructure  and the environment. Effective monitoring and mapping of landslides are crucial for mitigating these risks  guiding emergency responses  and supporting resilient infrastructure planning. Using multi-source satellite data  you will work to create an accurate landslide detection model. This model should differentiate landslide-affected areas from unaffected regions  leveraging both optical imagery and Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data. The provided datasets  sourced from Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2  include RGB and near-infrared bands as well as SAR bands (VV and VH) captured pre- and post-event. These data can reveal landscape changes and offer a unique view of the terrain  combining visual and radar-based insights to detect surface alterations and other indicators of landslides. While optical data is precise and interpretable  SAR data is invaluable in cloud-covered regions. Combining these datasets can improve detection accuracy  particularly in challenging conditions. The objective of this challenge is to create a model that effectively leverages SAR for cloud-covered regions while prioritising optical data where available  enabling accurate and reliable landslide detection. You also need to adhere to trustworthy AI guidelines to create solutions that extend beyond performance metrics  ensuring models are transparent  ethical  and impactful  with tangible benefits for society and disaster resilience efforts. The optical imagery is sourced from Sentinel-2  specifically from the MultiSpectral Instrument (MSI) at Level-2A  which provides Red  Green  Blue  and Near Infrared (NIR) bands with a resolution of 10 meters. Complementing this is radar imagery from Sentinel-1  which includes the VV and VH polarization bands (Vertical-Vertical and Vertical-Horizontal) at a similar resolution of 10 meters. The dataset includes post-event radar imagery  which captures backscatter intensity changes on the ground  and change detection bands calculated by subtracting pre-event from post-event data. The radar data is particularly useful as it can penetrate cloud cover  providing a consistent view of ground surface changes regardless of weather conditions. Together  these optical and radar datasets offer a multi-faceted perspective  combining visual and SAR data to detect ground disturbances that often accompany landslides. Additionally  the dataset is based on landslide inventories from various earthquake-triggered landslide events.

(2020). IoT-23: A labeled dataset with malicious and benign IoT network traffic (Version 1.0.0) [Data set]. Zenodo.http://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4743746‚Äù This dataset is created by converting the zeek network logs to csv files. To access the zeek logs and .pcap files refer tohttps://www.stratosphereips.org/datasets-iot23 Here there is a brief explanation about the labels used for malicious flows detection based on the manual network analysis: Attack: this label indicates that there was some type of attack from the infected device to another host. Here we are labeling as attack to any flow that  by analyzing its payload and behavior  tries to take advantage of some vulnerable service. For example  a brute force to some telnet login  a command injection in the header of a GET request  etc. Benign: this label indicates that no suspicious por malicious activities where found in the connections. C&C: this label indicates that the infected device was connected to a CC server. This activity was detected in the analysis of the network malware capture because the connections to the suspicious server are periodic or our infected device is downloading some binaries from it or some IRC like or decoded orders are coming and going from it. DDoS: this label indicates that a Distributed Denial of Service attack is being executed by the infected device. These traffic flows are detected as part of a DDoS ‚Äã‚Äãattack because of the amount of flows directed to the same IP address. FileDownload: this label indicates that a file is being downloaded to our infected device. This is detected by filtering connections with response bytes more than 3KB or 5KB  normally this is combined with some known suspicious destination port or destination IP known to be a C&C server. HeartBeat: this label indicates that packets sent on this connection are used to keep a track on the infected host by the C&C server. This was detected by filtering connections with response bytes lower than 1B and with periodic similar connections  normally this is combined with some known suspicious destination port or destination IP known to be a C&C server. Mirai: this label indicates that the connections have characteristics of a Mirai botnet. This label is added when the flows have similar patterns as the most common known Mirai attacks. Okiru: this label indicates that the connections have characteristics of a Okiru botnet. This labeling decision was made with the same parameters as with Mirai but with the difference that this botnet family is less common. PartOfAHorizontalPortScan: this label indicates that the connections are used to do a horizontal port scan to gather information to perform further attacks. To put these labels we rely on the pattern in which the connections shared the same port  a similar number of transmitted bytes and multiple different destination IPs. Torii: this label indicates that the connections have characteristics of a Torii botnet. This labeling decision was made with the same parameters as with Mirai but with the difference that this botnet family is less common.

The sound emitted when a person breathes is directly related to air movement  changes within lung tissue and the position of secretions within the lung. A wheezing sound  for example  is a common sign that a patient has an obstructive airway disease like asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). These sounds can be recorded using digital stethoscopes and other recording techniques. This digital data opens up the possibility of using machine learning to automatically diagnose respiratory disorders like asthma  pneumonia and bronchiolitis  to name a few. The Respiratory Sound Database was created by two research teams in Portugal and Greece. It includes 920 annotated recordings of varying length - 10s to 90s. These recordings were taken from 126 patients. There are a total of 5.5 hours of recordings containing 6898 respiratory cycles - 1864 contain crackles  886 contain wheezes and 506 contain both crackles and wheezes. The data includes both clean respiratory sounds as well as noisy recordings that simulate real life conditions. The patients span all age groups - children  adults and the elderly.

The reason is the unavailability of labeled dataset and the multi-class nature of the problem. Humans have a variety of emotions and it is difficult to collect enough records for each emotion and hence the problem of class imbalance arises. Here we have a labeled data for emotion detection and the objective is to build an efficient model to detect emotion. The data is basically a collection of tweets annotated with the emotions behind them. We have three columns tweet_id  sentiment  and content. In ""content"" we have the raw tweet. In ""sentiment"" we have the emotion behind the tweet. Refer to the starter notebook for more insights. This public domain dataset is collected from data.world platform.

We can combat this by creating models to automatically flag potentially harmful tweets as well as break down the patterns of hatred. As social media usage becomes increasingly prevalent in every age group  a vast majority of citizens rely on this essential medium for day-to-day communication. Social media‚Äôs ubiquity means that cyberbullying can effectively impact anyone at any time or anywhere  and the relative anonymityof the internet makes such personal attacks more difficult to stop than traditional bullying. On April 15th  2020  UNICEF issued a warning in response to the increased risk of cyberbullying during the COVID-19 pandemic due to widespread school closures  increased screen time  and decreased face-to-face social interaction. The statistics of cyberbullying are outright alarming: 36.5% of middle and high school students have felt cyberbullied and 87% have observed cyberbullying  with effects ranging from decreased academic performance to depression to suicidal thoughts. In light of all of this  this dataset contains more than47000tweets labelled according to the class of cyberbullying: The data has been balanced in order to contain ~8000 of each class. Trigger WarningThese tweets either describe a bullying event or are the offense themselves  therefore explore it to the point where you feel comfortable.

Data Set Information:Bike sharing systems are new generation of traditional bike rentals where whole process from membership  rental and return back has become automatic. Through these systems  user is able to easily rent a bike from a particular position and return back at another position. Currently  there are about over 500 bike-sharing programs around the world which is composed of over 500 thousands bicycles. Today  there exists great interest in these systems due to their important role in traffic  environmental and health issues.Apart from interesting real world applications of bike sharing systems  the characteristics of data being generated by these systems make them attractive for the research. Opposed to other transport services such as bus or subway  the duration of travel  departure and arrival position is explicitly recorded in these systems. This feature turns bike sharing system into a virtual sensor network that can be used for sensing mobility in the city. Hence  it is expected that most of important events in the city could be detected via monitoring these data.Attribute Information:Both hour.csv and day.csv have the following fields  except hr which is not available in day.csv

Acute lymphoblastic leukemia(ALL) is the most common type of childhood cancer and accounts for approximately 25% of the pediatric cancers. These cells have been segmented from microscopic images and are representative of images in the real-world because they contain some staining noise and illumination errors  although these errors have largely been fixed in the course of acquisition. The task of identifying immature leukemic blasts from normal cells under the microscope is challenging due to morphological similarity and thus the ground truth labels were annotated by an expert oncologist. In total there are15 135 imagesfrom118 patientswith two labelled classes: Create a image classification model to distinguish between normal and cancer cells.

Phishing is a kind of cybercrime where attackers pose as known or trusted entities and contact individuals through email  text or telephone and ask them to share sensitive information. Typically  in a phishing email attack  and the message will suggest that there is a problem with an invoice  that there has been suspicious activity on an account  or that the user must login to verify an account or password. Users may also be prompted to enter credit card information or bank account details as well as other sensitive data. Once this information is collected  attackers may use it to access accounts  steal data and identities  and download malware onto the user‚Äôs computer. This dataset contains 48 features extracted from 5000 phishing webpages and 5000 legitimate webpages  which were downloaded from January to May 2015 and from May to June 2017. An improved feature extraction technique is employed by leveraging the browser automation framework (i.e.  Selenium WebDriver)  which is more precise and robust compared to the parsing approach based on regular expressions. Anti-phishing researchers and experts may find this dataset useful for phishing features analysis  conducting rapid proof of concept experiments or benchmarking phishing classification models.

Retailer will use result to grove in his industry and provide for customer suggestions on itemset  we be able increase customer engagement and improve customer experience and identify customer behavior. I will solve this problem with use Association Rules type of unsupervised learning technique that checks for the dependency of one data item on another data  item. Association Rule is most used when you are planning to build association in different objects in a set. It works when you are planning to find frequent patterns in a transaction database. It can tell you what items do customers frequently buy together and it allows retailer to identify relationships between the items. Assume there are 100 customers  10 of them bought Computer Mouth  9 bought Mat for Mouse and 8 bought both of them. File name: Assignment-1_Data List name: retaildata File format: . xlsx Number of Row: 522065 Number of Attributes: 7 First  we need to  load required libraries. Shortly I describe all libraries. Next  we need to upload Assignment-1_Data. xlsx to R to read the dataset.Now we can see our data in R. After we will clear our data frame  will remove missing values. To apply Association Rule mining  we need to convert dataframe into transaction data to make all items that are bought together in one invoice will be in one row. Below lines of code will combine all products from one BillNo and Date and combine all products from that BillNo and Date as one row  with each item  separated by ( ) We don‚Äôt need BillNo and Date  we will make it as Null.Next  you have to store this transaction data into .csv This how should look transaction data before we will go to next step. At this step we already have our transaction dataset  and it shows the matrix of items which bought together. We can‚Äôt see here any rules and how often it was purchase together. Now let‚Äôs check how many transactions we have and what they are. We will have to have to load this transaction data into an object of the transaction class. This is done by using the R function read.transactions of the arules package. Our format of Data frame is basket. Let‚Äôs have a view our transaction object by summary(transaction) We can see 18193 transactions (rows) and 7698 items (columns). 7698 is the product descriptions and 18193 transactions are collections of these items. The summary gives us some useful information: Let‚Äôs check item frequency plot  we will generate an itemFrequencyPlot to create an item Frequency Bar Plot to view the distribution of objects based on itemMatrix (e.g.  >transactions or items in >itemsets and >rules) which is our case. In itemFrequencyPlot(transaction topN=20 type=""absolute"") first argument - our transaction object to be plotted that is tr. topN is allows us to plot top N highest frequency items. type can be as  type=""absolute"" or type=""relative"". If we will chouse absolute it will plot numeric frequencies of each item independently. If relative it will plot how many times these items have appeared as compared to others. As well I made it in colure for better visualization. Next  we will generate rules using the Apriori algorithm. The function apriori() is from package arules. The algorithm employs level-wise search for frequent itemsets. Algorithm will generate frequent itemsets and association rules. We pass supp=0.001 and conf=0.8 to return all the rules that have a support of at least 0.1% and confidence of at least 80%. We sort the rules by decreasing confidence and will check summary of the rules. The apriori will take (transaction) as the transaction object on which mining is to be applied. parameter will allow you to set min_sup and min_confidence. The default values for parameter are minimum support of 0.1  the minimum confidence of 0.8  maximum of 10 items (maxlen). Summary of rules give us clear information as: Now  97267 it a lot of rules. We will identify only top 10. Using the above output  you can make analysis such as: We have thousands of rules generated based on data  we will need a couple of ways to present our findings. We will use ItemFrequencyPlot to visualize association rules. A straight-forward visualization of association rules is to use a scatter plot using plot() of the arulesViz package. It uses Support and Confidence on the axes. In addition  third measure Liftis used by default to color (grey levels) of the points. We can have a look for each rule (interactively) and view all quality measures (support  confidence and lift). Graph plots are a great way to visualize rules but tend to become congested as the number of rules increases. So  it is better to visualize a smaller number of rules with graph-based visualizations.    We can see as well group method for top 10 items. Based on the results of these calculations can be used as a recommendation for retail owners to arrange the arrangement of product catalogs and take strategic steps to improve product marketing.. By utilizing the association rules which are discovered as a result of the analyses  the retailer can apply effective marketing and sales promotion strategies  he will be able increase customer engagement and improve customer experience and identify customer behavior."

After a bit of googling  I found a few datasets. Sadly  most of them had some issues that made them unusable for me (e.g  missing description of the book  a mix of different languages but no column to specify the language per row or weird delimiters). So I decided to make a dataset that would match my purposes. First  I got ISBNs fromSoumik's Goodreads-books dataset. Using those identifiers  I crawled the Google Books API to extract the books' information. Then  I merged those results with some of the original columns from the dataset and after some cleaning I got the dataset you see here. Different Exploratory Data Analysis  clustering of books by topics/category  content-based recommendation engine using different fields from the book's description. Many of the ISBNs of that dataset did not return valid results from the Google Books API. I plan to update this in the future  using more fields (e.g.  title  author) in the API requests  as to have a bigger dataset. Check out the repoistory hereGoogle Books Crawler This dataset relied heavily onSoumik's Goodreads-books dataset.

When factor analysis (a statistical technique) is applied to personality survey data  some words used to describe aspects of personality are often applied to the same person. For example  someone described as conscientious is more likely to be described as ""always prepared"" rather than ""messy"". This theory is based therefore on the association between words but not on neuropsychological experiments. This theory uses descriptors of common language and therefore suggests five broad dimensions commonly used to describe the human personality and psyche.

The original dataset from the reference consists of 5 different folders  each with 100 files  with each file representing a single subject/person. Each file is a recording of brain activity for 23.6 seconds. The corresponding time-series is sampled into 4097 data points. Each data point is the value of the EEG recording at a different point in time. So we have total 500 individuals with each has 4097 data points for 23.5 seconds. We divided and shuffled every 4097 data points into 23 chunks  each chunk contains 178 data points for 1 second  and each data point is the value of the EEG recording at a different point in time. So now we have 23 x 500 = 11500 pieces of information(row)  each information contains 178 data points for 1 second(column)  the last column represents the label y {1 2 3 4 5}. The response variable is y in column 179  the Explanatory variables X1  X2  ‚Ä¶  X178 y contains the category of the 178-dimensional input vector. Specifically y in {1  2  3  4  5}: 5 - eyes open  means when they were recording the EEG signal of the brain the patient had their eyes open 4 - eyes closed  means when they were recording the EEG signal the patient had their eyes closed 3 - Yes they identify where the region of the tumor was in the brain and recording the EEG activity from the healthy brain area 2 - They recorder the EEG from the area where the tumor was located 1 - Recording of seizure activity All subjects falling in classes 2  3  4  and 5 are subjects who did not have epileptic seizure. Only subjects in class 1 have epileptic seizure. Our motivation for creating this version of the data was to simplify access to the data via the creation of a .csv version of it. Although there are 5 classes most authors have done binary classification  namely class 1 (Epileptic seizure) against the rest.

Our dataset contains expert-generated high-quality photoshopped face images.The images are composite of different faces  separated by eyes  nose  mouth  or whole face.You may wonder why we need these expensive images other than images automatically generated by computers.Say we want to train a classifier for real and fake face images.In case of generative models likeGenerative Adversarial Networks(GAN)  it is very easy to generate fake face images.Then  a classifier can be trained using those images  and they do great job discriminating real and generated face images.We can easily assume that the classifier learns some kind of pattern between images generated by GANs.However  those patterns can be futile in front of human experts  since exquisite counterfeits by experts are created in completely different process.Thus we had to create our own dataset with expert level fake face photos. Inside the parent directory training_real/training_fakecontains real/fake face photos  respectively.In case of fake photos  we have three groups; easy  mid  and hard (these groups are separated subjectively  so we do not recommend using them as explicit categories).Also  you can use the filenames of fake images to see which part of faces are replaced (refer to the image below).

Metadata Collaborators Authors Coverage DOI Citation Provenance License Expected Update Frequency Activity Overview Views Downloads Engagement Comments Top Contributors Detail View Related Notebooks Similar Datasets,Air Pollutionis contamination of the indoor or outdoor environment by any chemical  physical or biological agent that modifies the natural characteristics of the atmosphere. Household combustion devices  motor vehicles  industrial facilities and forest fires are common sources of air pollution. Pollutants of major public health concern include particulate matter  carbon monoxide  ozone  nitrogen dioxide and sulfur dioxide. Outdoor and indoor air pollution cause respiratory and other diseases and are important sources of morbidity and mortality. This dataset provides geolocated information about the following pollutants: Nitrogen Dioxide [NO2] :Nitrogen Dioxideis one of the several nitrogen oxides. It is introduced into the air by natural phenomena like entry from stratosphere or lighting. At the surface level  however  NO2 forms from cars  trucks and buses emissions  power plants and off-road equipment. Exposure over short periods can aggravate respiratory diseases  like asthma. Longer exposures may contribute to develoment of asthma and respiratory infections. People with asthma  children and the elderly are at greater risk for the health effects of NO2. Ozone [O3] :TheOzonemolecule is harmful for outdoor air quality (if outside of the ozone layer). At surface level  ozone is created by chemical reactions between oxides of nitrogen and volatile organic compounds (VOC). Differently from the good ozone located in the upper atmosphere  ground level ozone can provoke several health problems like chest pain  coughing  throat irritation and airway inflammation. Furthermore it can reduce lung function and worsen bronchitis  emphysema  and asthma. Ozone affects also vegetation and ecosystems. In particular  it damages sensitive vegetation during the growing season. Carbon Monoxide [CO] :Carbon Monoxide is a colorless and odorless gas. Outdoor  it is emitted in the air above all by cars  trucks and other vehicles or machineries that burn fossil fuels. Such items like kerosene and gas space heaters  gas stoves also release CO affecting indoor air quality.Breathing air with a high concentration of CO reduces the amount of oxygen that can be transported in the blood stream to critical organs like the heart and brain. At very high levels  which are not likely to occur outdoor but which are possible in enclosed environments. CO can cause dizziness  confusion  unconsciousness and death. Particulate Matter [PM2.5] :AtmosphericParticulate Matter  also known as atmospheric aerosol particles  are complex mixtures of small solid and liquid matter that get into the air. If inhaled they can cause serious heart and lungs problem. They have been classified as group 1 carcinogen by the International Agengy for Research on Cancer (IARC). PM10 refers to those particules with a diameter of 10 micrometers or less. PM2.5 refers to those particles with a diameter of 2.5 micrometers or less. There is one dataset here.

Specifically  the datasets used in this year's challenge have been updated  since BraTS'18  with more routine clinically-acquired 3T multimodal MRI scans  with accompanying ground truth labels by expert board-certified neuroradiologists. Validation data will be released on July 15  through an email pointing to the accompanying leaderboard. This  will allow participants to obtain preliminary results in unseen data and also report it in their submitted papers  in addition to their cross-validated results on the training data. The ground truth of the validation data will not be provided to the participants  but multiple submissions to the online evaluation platform (CBICA's IPP) will be allowed. Finally  all participants will be presented with the same test data  which will be made available through email during 26 August-7 September and for a limited controlled time-window (48h)  before the participants are required to upload their final results in CBICA's IPP. The top-ranked participating teams will be invited before the end of September to prepare slides for a short oral presentation of their method during the BraTS challenge. All BraTS multimodal scans are available as NIfTI files (.nii.gz) and describe a) native (T1) and b) post-contrast T1-weighted (T1Gd)  c) T2-weighted (T2)  and d) T2 Fluid Attenuated Inversion Recovery (T2-FLAIR) volumes  and were acquired with different clinical protocols and various scanners from multiple (n=19) institutions  mentioned as data contributors here. All the imaging datasets have been segmented manually  by one to four raters  following the same annotation protocol  and their annotations were approved by experienced neuro-radiologists. Annotations comprise the GD-enhancing tumor (ET ‚Äî label 4)  the peritumoral edema (ED ‚Äî label 2)  and the necrotic and non-enhancing tumor core (NCR/NET ‚Äî label 1)  as described both in the BraTS 2012-2013 TMI paper and in the latest BraTS summarizing paper (also see Fig.1). The provided data are distributed after their pre-processing  i.e. co-registered to the same anatomical template  interpolated to the same resolution (1 mm^3) and skull-stripped. The BraTS data provided since BraTS'17 differs significantly from the data provided during the previous BraTS challenges (i.e.  2016 and backwards). The only data that have been previously used and are utilized again (during BraTS'17-'19) are the images and annotations of BraTS'12-'13  which have been manually annotated by clinical experts in the past. The data used during BraTS'14-'16 (from TCIA) have been discarded  as they described a mixture of pre- and post-operative scans and their ground truth labels have been annotated by the fusion of segmentation results from algorithms that ranked highly during BraTS'12 and '13. For BraTS'17  expert neuroradiologists have radiologically assessed the complete original TCIA glioma collections (TCGA-GBM  n=262 and TCGA-LGG  n=199) and categorized each scan as pre- or post-operative. Subsequently  all the pre-operative TCIA scans (135 GBM and 108 LGG) were annotated by experts for the various glioma sub-regions and included in this year's BraTS datasets. This year we provide the naming convention and direct filename mapping between the data of BraTS'19  BraTS'18  BraTS'17  and the TCGA-GBM and TCGA-LGG collections  available through The Cancer Imaging Archive (TCIA). The overall survival (OS) data  defined in days  are included in a comma-separated value (.csv) file with correspondences to the pseudo-identifiers of the imaging data. The .csv file also includes the age of patients  as well as the resection status. Note that only subjects with resection status of GTR (i.e.  Gross Total Resection) will be evaluated  and you are only expected to send your predicted survival data for those subjects.

Metadata Collaborators Authors Coverage DOI Citation Provenance License Expected Update Frequency Activity Overview Views Downloads Engagement Comments Top Contributors Detail View Related Notebooks Similar Datasets,Source:https://physionet.org/content/ptb-xl/1.0.1/ Electrocardiography (ECG) is a key diagnostic tool to assess the cardiac condition of a patient. Automatic ECG interpretation algorithms as diagnosis support systems promise large reliefs for the medical personnel - only on the basis of the number of ECGs that are routinely taken. However  the development of such algorithms requires large training datasets and clear benchmark procedures. In our opinion  both aspects are not covered satisfactorily by existing freely accessible ECG datasets. The PTB-XL ECG dataset is a large dataset of 21837 clinical 12-lead ECGs from 18885 patients of 10 second length. The raw waveform data was annotated by up to two cardiologists  who assigned potentially multiple ECG statements to each record. The in total 71 different ECG statements conform to the SCP-ECG standard and cover diagnostic  form  and rhythm statements. To ensure comparability of machine learning algorithms trained on the dataset  we provide recommended splits into training and test sets. In combination with the extensive annotation  this turns the dataset into a rich resource for the training and the evaluation of automatic ECG interpretation algorithms. The dataset is complemented by extensive metadata on demographics  infarction characteristics  likelihoods for diagnostic ECG statements as well as annotated signal properties. The waveform data underlying the PTB-XL ECG dataset was collected with devices from Schiller AG over the course of nearly seven years between October 1989 and June 1996. With the acquisition of the original database from Schiller AG  the full usage rights were transferred to the PTB. The records were curated and converted into a structured database within a long-term project at the Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt (PTB). The database was used in a number of publications  see e.g. [1 2]  but the access remained restricted until now. The Institutional Ethics Committee approved the publication of the anonymous data in an open-access database (PTB-2020-1). During the public release process in 2019  the existing database was streamlined with particular regard to usability and accessibility for the machine learning community. Waveform and metadata were converted to open data formats that can easily processed by standard software. ECGs and patients are identified by unique identifiers (ecg_idandpatient_id). Personal information in the metadata  such as names of validating cardiologists  nurses and recording site (hospital etc.) of the recording was pseudonymized. The date of birth only as age at the time of the ECG recording  where ages of more than 89 years appear in the range of 300 years in compliance with HIPAA standards. Furthermore  all ECG recording dates were shifted by a random offset for each patient. The ECG statements used for annotating the records follow the SCP-ECG standard [3]. In general  the dataset is organized as follows: The dataset comprises 21837 clinical 12-lead ECG records of 10 seconds length from 18885 patients  where 52% are male and 48% are female with ages covering the whole range from 0 to 95 years (median 62 and interquantile range of 22). The value of the dataset results from the comprehensive collection of many different co-occurring pathologies  but also from a large proportion of healthy control samples. The distribution of diagnosis is as follows  where we restrict for simplicity to diagnostic statements aggregated into superclasses (note: sum of statements exceeds the number of records because of potentially multiple labels per record): The waveform files are stored in WaveForm DataBase (WFDB) format with 16 bit precision at a resolution of 1ŒºV/LSB and a sampling frequency of 500Hz (records500/). For the user‚Äôs convenience we also release a downsampled versions of the waveform data at a sampling frequency of 100Hz (records100/). All relevant metadata is stored in ptbxl_database.csv with one row per record identified by ecg_id. It contains 28 columns that can be categorized into: All information related to the used annotation scheme is stored in a dedicatedscp_statements.csvthat was enriched with mappings to other annotation standards such as AHA  aECGREFID  CDISC and DICOM. We provide additional side-information such as the category each statement can be assigned to (diagnostic  form and/or rhythm). For diagnostic statements  we also provide a proposed hierarchical organization intodiagnostic_classanddiagnostic_subclass. Inexample_physionet.pywe provide a minimal usage example that shows how to load waveform data (numpy-arraysX_trainandX_test) and labels (y_trainandy_test) making use of the proposed train-test split. For illustration  we use diagnostic subclass statements as labels based on the assignments inscp_statements.csv.

Metadata Collaborators Authors Coverage DOI Citation Provenance License Expected Update Frequency Activity Overview Views Downloads Engagement Comments Top Contributors Detail View Related Notebooks Similar Datasets,The Kvasir-SEG dataset (size 46.2 MB) contains 1000 polyp images and their corresponding ground truth from the Kvasir Dataset v2. The images' resolution in Kvasir-SEG varies from 332x487 to 1920x1072 pixels. The images and its corresponding masks are stored in two separate folders with the same filename. The image files are encoded using JPEG compression  facilitating online browsing. The open-access dataset can be easily downloaded for research and educational purposes. The Kvasir-SEG dataset is intended to be used for researching and developing new and improved methods for segmentation  detection  localization  and classification of polyps. Multiple datasets are prerequisites for comparing computer vision-based algorithms  and this dataset is useful both as a training dataset or as a validation dataset. These datasets can assist the development of state-of-the-art solutions for images captured by colonoscopes from different manufacturers. Further research in this field has the potential to help reduce the polyp miss rate and thus improve examination quality. The Kvasir-SEG dataset is also suitable for general segmentation and bounding box detection research. In this context  the datasets can accompany several other datasets from a wide range of fields  both medical and otherwise. We uploaded the entire Kvasir polyp class to Labelbox and created all the segmentations using this application. The Labelbox is a tool used for labeling the region of interest (ROI) in image frames  i.e.  the polyp regions for our case. We manually annotated and labeled all of the 1000 images with the help of medical experts. After annotation  we exported the files to generate masks for each annotation. The exported JSON file contained all the information about the image and the coordinate points for generating the mask. To create a mask  we used ROI coordinates to draw contours on an empty black image and fill the contours with white color. The generated masks are a 1-bit color depth images. The pixels depicting polyp tissue  the region of interest  are represented by the foreground (white mask)  while the background (in black) does not contain positive pixels. Some of the original images contain the image of the endoscope position marking probe  ScopeGuide TM  Olympus Tokyo Japan  located in one of the bottom corners  seen as a small green box. As this information is superfluous for the segmentation task  we have replaced these with black boxes in the Kvasir-SEG dataset. There are different metrics for evaluating the performance of the architectures on the image segmentation dataset. For medical image segmentation task  the most commonly used ones are Dice coefficient and Intersection over Union (IOU). Based on related work in this field  we have used these metrics for the evaluation of the algorithms. In future work  we encourage the use of these metrics for evaluating the performance of the model. In the future  it might be even better to include as many as possible metrics for the fair comparison of the models.

They include celebrities with large followings to niche content creators with a loyal following on social-media platforms such as YouTube  Instagram  Facebook  and Twitter.Their followers range in number from hundreds of millions to 1 000. Influencers may be categorized in tiers (mega-  macro-  micro-  and nano-influencers)  based on their number of followers. Businesses pursue people who aim to lessen their consumption of advertisements  and are willing to pay their influencers more. Targeting influencers is seen as increasing marketing's reach  counteracting a growing tendency by prospective customers to ignore marketing. Marketing researchers Kapitan and Silvera find that influencer selection extends into product personality. This product and benefit matching is key. For a shampoo  it should use an influencer with good hair. Likewise  a flashy product may use bold colors to convey its brand. If an influencer is not flashy  they will clash with the brand. Matching an influencer with the product's purpose and mood is important.

Metadata Collaborators Authors Coverage DOI Citation Provenance License Expected Update Frequency Activity Overview Views Downloads Engagement Comments Top Contributors Detail View Related Notebooks Similar Datasets,Tetouan is a city located in the north of Morocco which occupies an area of around 10375 km¬≤ and its population is about 550.374 inhabitants  according to the last Census of 2014  and is increasing rapidly  approximately 1.96% annually. Since it is located along the Mediterranean Sea  its weather is mild and rainy in the winter  hot and dry during the summer months. Morocco's per capita energy consumption is 0.56 toe (around 42% below the North Africa average)  including around 900 kWh of electricity (38% below the regional average) (2020). The progression of total energy consumption slowed down between 2010 and 2019 (+3 %/year  compared to 4.5%/year over 2000-2010) and decreased by 7% in 2020 to around 21 Mtoe. The national production of hydrocarbons is low. All the oil products are imported since the shutdown of the sole refinery of the country in 2015 (200 000 bbl/d). Oil product imports increased rapidly from 2015 to 2019 (+6%/year) and decreased by 12% in 2020 due to the COVID crisis. The power consumption data was collected from Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition System (SCADA) of Amendis which is a public service operator and in charge of the distribution of drinking water and electricity since 2002. The purpose of the electricity distribution network is to serve low and medium voltage consumers in Tetouan regions. For this purpose  the delivery and distribution of electrical energy from the point of delivery to the end user  the customer  is ensured by Amendis. The energy which is distributed comes from the National Office of Electricity and Drinking Water. After transforming the high voltage (63 kV) to medium voltage (20 kV)  it is allowed to transport and distribute the energy. With the electricity consumption being so crucial to the country  the idea is to study the impact on energy consumption. The dataset is exhaustive in its demonstration of energy consumption of the T√©touan city in Morocco. The distribution network is powered by 3 Zone stations  namely: Quads  Smir and Boussafou. The data consists of 52 416 observations of energy consumption on a 10-minute window. Every observation is described by 9 feature columns. fedesoriano. (August 2022). Electric Power Consumption.

Just kidding  I actually originally decided to collect this dataset in order to demonstrate basic signal processing concepts  such as filtering  Fourier transform  auto-correlation  cross-correlation  etc‚Ä¶  (for a data analysis course I'm currently preparing).I wanted to demonstrate these concepts on signals that we all have intimate familiarity with and hope that this way these concepts will be better understood than with just made up signals. The weather is excellent for demonstrating these kinds of concepts as it contains periodic temporal structure with two very different periods (daily and yearly). The dataset contains ~5 years ofhigh temporal resolution(hourly measurements) data of various weather attributes  such as temperature  humidity  air pressure  etc.This data is available for 30 US and Canadian Cities  as well as 6 Israeli cities.I've organized the data according to a common time axis for easy use.Each attribute has it's own file and is organized such that the rows are the time axis (it's the same time axis for all files)  and the columns are the different cities (it's the same city ordering for all files as well).Additionally  for each city we also have the country  latitude and longitude information in a separate file. The dataset was aquired usingWeather APIon theOpenWeatherMap website  and is available under theODbL License. Weather data is both intrinsically interesting  and also potentially useful when correlated with other types of data.For example Wildfirespread is potentially related to weather conditions  demand for cabs is famously known to be correlated with weather conditions (here hereandhereyou can find NYC cab ride data)  and use of city bikes is probably also correlated with weather in interesting ways (check outthis Austin dataset this SF dataset this Montreal dataset  andthis NYC dataset).Trafficis also probably related to weather.Another potentially interesting source of correlation is between weather and crime. Here are a few crime datasets on kaggle of cities present in this weather dataset:Chicago Philadelphia Los Angeles Vancouver Austin NYC There are many other potentially interesting connections between everyday life and the weather that we can explore together with the help of this dataset.

I hope it will prove to be as interesting to work with for you as it has been for me! The data set contains over two decades of data on each player who has been part of an NBA teams' roster. It captures demographic variables such as age  height  weight and place of birth  biographical details like the team played for  draft year and round. In addition  it has basic box score statistics such as games played  average number of points  rebounds  assists  etc. The pull initially contained 52 rows of missing data. The gaps have been manually filled using data fromBasketball Reference. I am not aware of any other data quality issues. The data set can be used to explore how age/height/weight tendencies have changed over time due to changes in game philosophy and player development strategies. Also  it could be interesting to see how geographically diverse the NBA is and how oversees talents have influenced it. A longitudinal study on players' career arches can also be performed.

Metadata Collaborators Authors Coverage DOI Citation Provenance License Expected Update Frequency Activity Overview Views Downloads Engagement Comments Top Contributors Detail View Related Notebooks Similar Datasets,The transmission line is the most crucial part of the power system. The requirement of power and its allegiance has grown up exponentially over the modern era  and the prominent role of a transmission line is to transmit electric power from the source area to the distribution network. The electrical power system consists of so many complex dynamic and interacting elements that are always prone to disturbance or an electrical fault.High-capacity electrical generating power plants and the grid concept  i.e.  synchronized electrical power plants and geographical d displaced grids  required fault detection and operation of protection equipment in minimum possible time to remain stable. The faults on electrical power system transmission lines are supposed to be first detected and classified correctly and should be cleared in the least possible time. The protection system used for a transmission line can also initiate the other relays to protect the power system from outages. An exemplary fault detection system provides a practical  reliable  fast  and secure way of a relaying operation. The application of pattern recognition technology could help discriminate against faulty and healthy electrical power systems. It also enables us to differentiate among three phases of a three-phase power system experiencing a fault.The artificial neural networks (ANNs) are potent in identifying the faulty pattern and classification of fault by pattern recognition. An efficient and reliable protection method should perform more than satisfactorily under various system operating conditions and different electrical network parameters. As far as ANNs are considered  they exhibit excellent normalization and generalization capability  immunity to noise  robustness  and fault tolerance. Therefore  the declaration of fault made by the ANN-based fault detection method should not be affected seriously by variations in various power system parameters.The various electrical transient system faults are modeled  simulated  and Various ANN-based algorithms are developed to recognize these faulty patterns. The performance of the proposed algorithm is evaluated by simulating the various types of fault and the results obtained are encouraging. We have modeled a power system in MATLAB to simulate fault analysis. The power system consists of 4 generators of 11 √ó 10^3 V  each pair located at each end of the transmission line. Transformers are present in between to simulate and study the various faults at the midpoint of the transmission line.We simulate the circuit under normal conditions as well as under various fault conditions. We then collect and save the measured Line Voltages and Line Currents at the output side of the power system. We collected nearly 12000 data points  and then the data is labeled. We wouldn't be here without the help of others.We want to extend our gratitude to the authors ofthispaper for helping us out in publishing this dataset.

Metadata Collaborators Authors Coverage DOI Citation Provenance License Expected Update Frequency Activity Overview Views Downloads Engagement Comments Top Contributors Detail View Related Notebooks Similar Datasets,The DRIVE: Digital Retinal Images for Vessel Extraction dataset was made publichere.No license was specified  yet all credits are due to the original authors. The DRIVE database has been established to enable comparative studies on segmentation of blood vessels in retinal images. Retinal vessel segmentation and delineation of morphological attributes of retinal blood vessels  such as length  width  tortuosity  branching patterns and angles are utilized for the diagnosis  screening  treatment  and evaluation of various cardiovascular and ophthalmologic diseases such as diabetes  hypertension  arteriosclerosis and chorodial neovascularization. Automatic detection and analysis of the vasculature can assist in the implementation of screening programs for diabetic retinopathy  can aid research on the relationship between vessel tortuosity and hypertensive retinopathy  vessel diameter measurement in relation with diagnosis of hypertension  and computer-assisted laser surgery. Automatic generation of retinal maps and extraction of branch points have been used for temporal or multimodal image registration and retinal image mosaic synthesis. Moreover  the retinal vascular tree is found to be unique for each individual and can be used for biometric identification. The photographs for the DRIVE database were obtained from a diabetic retinopathy screening program in The Netherlands. The screening population consisted of 400 diabetic subjects between 25-90 years of age. Forty photographs have been randomly selected  33 do not show any sign of diabetic retinopathy and 7 show signs of mild early diabetic retinopathy. Here is a brief description of the abnormalities in these 7 cases: Each image has been JPEG compressed. The images were acquired using a Canon CR5 non-mydriatic 3CCD camera with a 45 degree field of view (FOV). Each image was captured using 8 bits per color plane at 768 by 584 pixels. The FOV of each image is circular with a diameter of approximately 540 pixels. For this database  the images have been cropped around the FOV. For each image  a mask image is provided that delineates the FOV. The set of 40 images has been divided into a training and a test set  both containing 20 images. For the training images  a single manual segmentation of the vasculature is available. For the test cases  two manual segmentations are available; one is used as gold standard  the other one can be used to compare computer generated segmentations with those of an independent human observer. Furthermore  a mask image is available for every retinal image  indicating the region of interest. All human observers that manually segmented the vasculature were instructed and trained by an experienced ophthalmologist. They were asked to mark all pixels for which they were for at least 70% certain that they were vessel. Seehttps://drive.grand-challenge.org/DRIVE/for the original web-page on this challenge

This repository also contains the modeling codes and will be updated continually  so welcome starring or watching! Stock market data can be interesting to analyze and as a further incentive  strong predictive models can have large financial payoff. The amount of financial data on the web is seemingly endless. A large and well structured dataset on a wide array of companies can be hard to come by. Here provided a dataset with historical stock prices (last 12 years) for 29 of 30 DJIA companies (excluding 'V' because it does not have the whole 12 years data). In the future if you wish for a more up to date dataset  this can be used to acquire new versions of the .csv files. The data is presented in a couple of formats to suit different individual's needs or computational limitations.I have included files containing 13 years of stock data (in the all_stocks_2006-01-01_to_2018-01-01.csv and corresponding folder) anda smaller version of the dataset (all_stocks_2017-01-01_to_2018-01-01.csv) with only the past year's stock data for those wishing to use something more manageable in size. The folder individual_stocks_2006-01-01_to_2018-01-01 contains files of data for individual stocks  labelled by their stock ticker name.The all_stocks_2006-01-01_to_2018-01-01.csv and all_stocks_2017-01-01_to_2018-01-01.csv contain this same data  presented in merged .csv files.Depending on the intended use (graphing  modelling etc.) the user may prefer one of these given formats. All the files have the following columns:Date - in format: yy-mm-dd Open - price of the stock at market open (this is NYSE data so all in USD) High - Highest price reached in the day Low    Close - Lowest price reached in the day Volume - Number of shares traded Name - the stock's ticker name This dataset lends itself to a some very interesting visualizations. One can look at simple things like how prices change over time  graph an compare multiple stocks at once  or generate and graph new metrics from the data provided.From these data informative stock stats such as volatility and moving averages can be easily calculated.The million dollar question is: can you develop a model that can beat the market and allow you to make statistically informed trades!

Data Gathering Equipment and Data Augmentation Images were collected via 2 different cameras  Kodak Easyshare Z650 and Samsung ST60.Therefore  the resolution of the images are 2832 x 2128  1024 x 768  respectively. Before the segmentation  feature extraction  and classification process  the dataset was resized to 590 x 445by preserving the aspect ratio. After resizing the images  all labels in the dataset were augmented (by flipping and rotating). At the end of the augmentation process  the number of total images for each class became 2000; 1000 for the RGB fish imagesand 1000 for their pair-wise ground truth labels. Description of the dataset The dataset contains 9 different seafood types. For each class  there are 1000 augmented images and their pair-wise augmented ground truths.Each class can be found in the ""Fish_Dataset"" file with their ground truth labels. All images for each class are ordered from ""00000.png"" to ""01000.png"". For example  if you want to access the ground truth images of the shrimp in the dataset  the order should be followed is ""Fish->Shrimp->Shrimp GT""."

According to the government  the total Medicare spending increased exponentially due to frauds in Medicare claims. Healthcare fraud is an organized crime which involves peers of providers  physicians  beneficiaries acting together to make fraud claims. Rigorous analysis of Medicare data has yielded many physicians who indulge in fraud. They adopt ways in which an ambiguous diagnosis code is used to adopt costliest procedures and drugs. Insurance companies are the most vulnerable institutions impacted due to these bad practices. Due to this reason  insurance companies increased their insurance premiums and as result healthcare is becoming costly matter day by day. Healthcare fraud and abuse take many forms. Some of the most common types of frauds by providers are: a) Billing for services that were not provided. b) Duplicate submission of a claim for the same service. c) Misrepresenting the service provided. d) Charging for a more complex or expensive service than was actually provided. e) Billing for a covered service when the service actually provided was not covered. Problem StatementThe goal of this project is to "" predict the potentially fraudulent providers "" based on the claims filed by them.along with this  we will also discover important variables helpful in detecting the behaviour of potentially fraud providers. further  we will study fraudulent patterns in the provider's claims to understand the future behaviour of providers. Introduction to the DatasetFor the purpose of this project  we are considering Inpatient claims  Outpatient claims and Beneficiary details of each provider. Lets s see their details : A) Inpatient Data This data provides insights about the claims filed for those patients who are admitted in the hospitals. It also provides additional details like their admission and discharge dates and admit d diagnosis code. B) Outpatient Data This data provides details about the claims filed for those patients who visit hospitals and not admitted in it. C) Beneficiary Details Data This data contains beneficiary KYC details like health conditions regioregion they belong to etc."

The database is created by the Institute of Communication Science  Technical University  Berlin  Germany. Ten professional speakers (five males and five females) participated in data recording. The database contains a total of 535 utterances. The EMODB database comprises of seven emotions: 1) anger; 2) boredom; 3) anxiety; 4) happiness; 5) sadness; 6) disgust; and 7) neutral. The data was recorded at a 48-kHz sampling rate and then down-sampled to 16-kHz. Every utterance is named according to the same scheme: Example: 03a01Fa.wav is the audio file from Speaker 03 speaking text a01 with the emotion ""Freude"" (Happiness). EMOTION classification from speech has an increasing interest in the field of the speech processing area. The objective of the emotion classification is to classify different emotions from the speech signal. A person‚Äôs emotional state affects the production mechanism of speech  and due to this  breathing rate and muscle tension change from the neutral condition. Therefore  the resulting speech signal may have different characteristics from that of neutral speech. The performance of speech recognition or speaker recognition decreases significantly if the model is trained with neutral speech and it is tested with an emotional speech. So we as a Machine Learning Enthusiast can start working on speaker emotion recognition problems and can come up with some good robust models."

Mathematical Problems in Engineering  Vol.2021  Article ID: 4793293  DOI:10.1155/2021/4793293https://www.hindawi.com/journals/mpe/2021/4793293/ Abstract: A great number of fruits are grown around the world  each of which has various types. The factors that determine the type of fruit are the external appearance features such as color  length  diameter  and shape. The external appearance of the fruits is a major determinant of the fruit type. Determining the variety of fruits by looking at their external appearance may necessitate expertise  which is time-consuming and requires great effort. The aim of this study is to classify the types of date fruit  that are  Barhee  Deglet Nour  Sukkary  Rotab Mozafati  Ruthana  Safawi  and Sagai by using three different machine learning methods. In accordance with this purpose  898 images of seven different date fruit types were obtained via the computer vision system (CVS). Through image processing techniques  a total of 34 features  including morphological features  shape  and color  were extracted from these images. First  models were developed by using the logistic regression (LR) and artificial neural network (ANN) methods  which are among the machine learning methods. Performance results achieved with these methods are 91.0% and 92.2%  respectively. Then  with the stacking model created by combining these models  the performance result was increased to 92.8%. It has been concluded that machine learning methods can be applied successfully for the classification of date fruit types.

The goal is to achieve good performance (or as low degradation as possible) over time  as reported in the paper mentioned below in Section 2: Data collection. The primary purpose of providing this dataset is to make it freely accessible on-line to the chemo-sensor research community and artificial intelligence to develop strategies to cope with sensor/concept drift. The dataset can be used exclusively for research purposes. Commercial purposes are fully excluded.The dataset was gathered within January 2007 to February 2011 (36 months) in a gas delivery platform facility situated at the ChemoSignals Laboratory in the BioCircuits Institute  University of California San Diego. Being completely operated by a fully computerized environment √¢‚Ç¨‚Äùcontrolled by a LabVIEW√¢‚Ç¨‚ÄúNational Instruments software on a PC fitted with the appropriate serial data acquisition boards. The measurement system platform provides versatility for obtaining the desired concentrations of the chemical substances of interest with high accuracy and in a highly reproducible manner  minimizing thereby the common mistakes caused by human intervention and making it possible to exclusively concentrate on the chemical sensors for compensating real drift.The resulting dataset comprises recordings from six distinct pure gaseous substances  namely Ammonia  Acetaldehyde  Acetone  Ethylene  Ethanol  and Toluene  each dosed at a wide variety of concentration values ranging from 5 to 1000 ppmv. See Tables 1 and 2 of the below cited manuscript for details on the gas identity name  concentration values  and time distribution sequence of the measurement recordings considered in this dataset.

Moreover  17 additional measurement profiles were added  expanding the dataset from 138 hours to 185 hours of records. The data set comprises several sensor data collected from a permanent magnet synchronous motor (PMSM) deployed on a test bench. The PMSM represents a german OEM's prototype model. Test bench measurements were collected by theLEA departmentat Paderborn University. All recordings are sampled at 2 Hz. The data set consists of multiple measurement sessions  which can be distinguished from each other by column ""profile_id"". A measurement session can be between one and six hours long. The motor is excited by hand-designed driving cycles denoting a reference motor speed and a reference torque.Currents in d/q-coordinates (columns ""i_d"" and i_q"") and voltages in d/q-coordinates (columns ""u_d"" and ""u_q"") are a result of a standard control strategy trying to follow the reference speed and torque.Columns ""motor_speed"" and ""torque"" are the resulting quantities achieved by that strategy  derived from set currents and voltages. Most driving cycles denote random walks in the speed-torque-plane in order to imitate real world driving cycles to a more accurate degree than constant excitations and ramp-ups and -downs would. Several publications leveraged the setup of the PMSM in the Paderborn University Lab: Please cite the following publication if you intend to use this dataset for your own publications: The most interesting target features are rotor temperature (""pm"")  stator temperatures (""stator_*"") and torque.Especially rotor temperature and torque are not reliably and economically measurable in a commercial vehicle. Being able to have strong estimators for the rotor temperature helps the automotive industry to manufacture motors with less material and enables control strategies to utilize the motor to its maximum capability.A precise torque estimate leads to more accurate and adequate control of the motor  reducing power losses and eventually heat build-up."

Metadata Collaborators Authors Coverage DOI Citation Provenance License Update Frequency Activity Overview Views Downloads Engagement Comments Top Contributors Detail View Related Notebooks Similar Datasets,A Brain tumor is considered as one of the aggressive diseases  among children and adults. Brain tumors account for 85 to 90 percent of all primary Central Nervous System(CNS) tumors. Every year  around 11 700 people are diagnosed with a brain tumor. The 5-year survival rate for people with a cancerous brain or CNS tumor is approximately 34 percent for men and36 percent for women. Brain Tumors are classified as: Benign Tumor  Malignant Tumor  Pituitary Tumor  etc. Proper treatment  planning  and accurate diagnostics should be implemented to improve the life expectancy of the patients. The best technique to detect brain tumors is Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). A huge amount of image data is generated through the scans. These images are examined by the radiologist. A manual examination can be error-prone due to the level of complexities involved in brain tumors and their properties.Application of automated classification techniques using Machine Learning(ML) and Artificial Intelligence(AI)has consistently shown higher accuracy than manual classification. Hence  proposing a system performing detection and classification by using Deep Learning Algorithms using Convolution-Neural Network (CNN)  Artificial Neural Network (ANN)  and Transfer-Learning (TL) would be helpful to doctors all around the world. Brain Tumors are complex. There are a lot of abnormalities in the sizes and location of the brain tumor(s). This makes it really difficult for complete understanding of the nature of the tumor. Also  a professional Neurosurgeon is required for MRI analysis. Often times in developing countries the lack of skillful doctors and lack of knowledge about tumors makes it really challenging and time-consuming to generate reports from MRI‚Äô. So an automated system on Cloud can solve this problem. To Detect and Classify Brain Tumor using  CNN and TL; as an asset of Deep Learning and to examine the tumor position(segmentation). The dataset contains 3 folders: yes  no and pred which contains 3060 Brain MRI Images.

This technology poses a significant ethical threat and could lead to breaches of privacy and misrepresentation  thus there is an urgent need for real-time detection of AI-generated speech for DeepFake Voice Conversion. To address the above emerging issues  we are introducing the DEEP-VOICE dataset. DEEP-VOICE is comprised of real human speech from eight well-known figures and their speech converted to one another using Retrieval-based Voice Conversion. For each speech  the accompaniment (""background noise"") was removed before conversion using RVC. The original accompaniment is then added back to the DeepFake speech: (Above: Overview of the Retrieval-based Voice Conversion process to generate DeepFake speech with Ryan Gosling's speech converted to Margot Robbie. Conversion is run on the extracted vocals before being layered on the original background ambience.) There are two forms to the dataset that are made available. First  the raw audio can be found in the ""AUDIO"" directory. They are arranged within ""REAL"" and ""FAKE"" class directories. The audio filenames note which speakers provided the real speech  and which voices they were converted to. For example ""Obama-to-Biden"" denotes that Barack Obama's speech has been converted to Joe Biden's voice. Second  the extracted features can be found in the ""DATASET-balanced.csv"" file. This is the data that was used in the below study. The dataset has each feature extracted from one-second windows of audio and are balanced through random sampling. **Note: ** All experimental data is found within the ""KAGGLE"" directory. The ""DEMONSTRATION"" directory is used for playing cropped and compressed demos in notebooks due to Kaggle's limitations on file size. A potential use of a successful system could be used for the following: (Above: Usage of the real-time system. The end user is notified when the machine learning model has processed the speech audio (e.g. a phone or conference call) and predicted that audio chunks contain AI-generated speech.)

Metadata Collaborators Authors Coverage DOI Citation Provenance License Expected Update Frequency Activity Overview Views Downloads Engagement Comments Top Contributors Detail View Related Notebooks Similar Datasets,The task of image-based virtual try-on aims to transfer a target clothing item onto the corresponding region of a person  which is commonly tackled by fitting the item to the desired body part and fusing the warped item with the person.  While an increasing number of studies have been conducted  the resolution of synthesized images is still limited to low (e.g.  256x192)  which acts as the critical limitation against satisfying online consumers.  We argue that the limitation stems from several challenges: as the resolution increases  the artifacts in the misaligned areas between the warped clothes and the desired clothing regions become noticeable in the final results;  the architectures used in existing methods have low performance in generating high-quality body parts and maintaining the texture sharpness of the clothes.  To address the challenges  we propose a novel virtual try-on method called VITON-HD that successfully synthesizes 1024x768 virtual try-on images.  Specifically  we first prepare the segmentation map to guide our virtual try-on synthesis  and then roughly fit the target clothing item to a given person's body.  Next  we propose ALIgnment-Aware Segment (ALIAS) normalization and ALIAS generator to handle the misaligned areas and preserve the details of 1024x768 inputs.  Through rigorous comparison with existing methods  we demonstrate that VITON-HD highly surpasses the baselines in terms of synthesized image quality both qualitatively and quantitatively.

Metadata Collaborators Authors Coverage DOI Citation Provenance License Expected Update Frequency Activity Overview Views Downloads Engagement Comments Top Contributors Detail View Similar Datasets,This dataset is curated to support the development and evaluation of intelligent fabric defect detection systems in textile manufacturing environments. High-resolution CMOS-based smart cameras (Basler ace 2 Pro  12 MP  USB 3.0) were mounted above the fabric flow at critical inspection points such as pre-finishing stages. These cameras were configured with adjustable focal lenses and LED backlighting paired with polarizing filters to ensure consistent illumination  reduce glare  and minimize shadow effects across fabric types. Each image was captured at a fixed resolution of 1280√ó720 pixels and stored in lossless PNG format. The capture frequency was dynamically controlled using proximity and rotary encoders  set to one image every 0.5 seconds to match standard production belt speeds (approx. 15‚Äì25 m/min) without introducing motion blur. It contains 3077 high-resolution fabric images categorized into nine classes: defect-free  hole  horizontal  vertical  lines  pinched fabric  needle mark  broken stitch and stain. The images were collected directly from real-world production lines  ensuring a diverse representation of fabric types  textures  and defect severities. Each class reflects common challenges in textile quality control  with 'hole' being the most frequent defect and 'defect-free' samples serving as critical references for false-positive reduction. The dataset aims to facilitate training and benchmarking of machine learning and deep learning models  particularly for embedded AI applications that require fast  accurate detection under resource constraints. Key features: Real-world fabric defects captured in controlled manufacturing environments. Imbalanced class distribution reflecting actual occurrence rates on production lines. Suitable for classification  object detection  and anomaly detection tasks. Ideal for use with CNNs  YOLO variants  and edge-optimized AI models. This dataset supports research in automated textile inspection  embedded computer vision  and AI-assisted quality assurance in Industry 4.0 settings.

Metadata Collaborators Authors Coverage DOI Citation Provenance License Expected Update Frequency Activity Overview Views Downloads Engagement Comments Top Contributors Detail View Similar Datasets,Type-A aortic dissection (TAAD) is a cardiac emergency in which rapid diagnosis  prognosis prediction  andsurgical planning are critical for patient survival. A comprehensive understanding of the anatomic structuresand related features of TAAD patients is the key to completing these tasks. However  due to the emergent natureof this disease and requirement of advanced expertise  manual segmentation of these anatomic structuresis not routinely available in clinical practice. Currently  automatic segmentation of TAAD is a focus of thecardiovascular imaging research. However  existing works have two limitations: no comprehensive publicdataset and lack of clinically-oriented evaluation. To address these limitations  in this paper we proposeimageTAAD  the first comprehensive segmentation dataset of TAAD with clinically-oriented evaluation. Thedataset is comprised of 120 cases  and each case is annotated by medical experts with 35 foreground classesreflecting the clinical needs for diagnosis  prognosis prediction and surgical planning for TAAD. In addition we have identified four key clinical features for clinically-oriented evaluation. We also propose SegTAAD  abaseline method for comprehensive segmentation of TAAD. SegTAAD utilizes two pieces of domain knowledge:(1) the boundaries play a key role in the evaluation of clinical features  and can enhance the segmentationperformance  and (2) the tear is located between TL and FL. We have conducted intensive experiments witha variety of state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods  and experimental results have shown that our method achievesSOTA performance on the ImageTAAD dataset in terms of overall DSC score  95% Hausdorff distance  andfour clinical features. In our study  we also found an interesting phenomenon that a higher DSC score doesnot necessarily indicate better accuracy in clinical feature extraction.

It is only natural then to extend this communication medium to computer applications. We define speech emotion recognition (SER) systems as a collection of methodologies that process and classify speech signals to detect the embedded emotions. SER is not a new field  it has been around for over two decades  and has regained attention thanks to the recent advancements. These novel studies make use of the advances in all fields of computing and technology  making it necessary to have an update on the current methodologies and techniques that make SER possible.

Metadata Collaborators Authors Coverage DOI Citation Provenance License Expected Update Frequency Activity Overview Views Downloads Engagement Comments Top Contributors Detail View Related Notebooks Similar Datasets,By Josh Murrey[source] The Books Dataset: Sales  Ratings  and Publication provides comprehensive information on various aspects of books  including their publishing year  author details  ratings given by readers  sales performance data  and genre classification. The dataset consists of several key columns that capture important attributes related to each book. The Publishing Year column indicates the year in which each book was published. This information helps in understanding the chronological distribution of books in the dataset. The Book Name column contains the titles of the books. Each book has a unique name that distinguishes it from others in the dataset. The Author column specifies the name(s) of the author(s) responsible for creating each book. This information is crucial for understanding different authors' contributions and analyzing their impact on sales and ratings. The language_code column represents a specific code assigned to indicate the language in which each book is written. This code serves as a reference point for language-based analysis within the dataset. Each author's rating is captured in the Author_Rating column. This rating is based on their previous works and serves as an indicator of their reputation or acclaim among readers. The average rating given by readers for each book is recorded in the Book_average_rating column. This value reflects how well-received a particular book is by its audience. The number of ratings given to each book by readers can be found in the Book_ratings_count column. This metric helps gauge reader engagement and provides insights into popular or widely-discussed books within this dataset. Books are classified into different genres or categories which are mentioned under the genre column. Genre classification allows for analyzing trends across specific literary genres or identifying patterns related to certain types of books. Sales-related data includes both gross sales revenue (gross sales) generated by each book and publisher revenue (publisher revenue) earned from these sales transactions. These numeric values provide insights into financial performance aspects associated with the book market. The sale price column denotes the specific price at which each book is sold. This information helps evaluate pricing strategies and their potential impact on sales figures. Sales performance is further quantified through the sales rank column  which assigns a numerical rank to each book based on its sales performance. This ranking system aids in identifying high-performing books within the dataset. Lastly  the units sold column captures the number of units of each book that have been sold. This data highlights popular books based on reader demand and serves as a crucial measure of commercial success within the dataset. Overall  this expansive and comprehensive Books Dataset Introduction: Getting Familiar with the Columns:The dataset contains multiple columns that provide different kinds of information: Book Name: The title of each book. Author: The name of the author who wrote the book. language_code: The code representing the language in which the book is written. Author_Rating: The rating assigned to the author based on their previous works. Book_average_rating: The average rating given to the book by readers. Book_ratings_count: The number of ratings given to the book by readers. genre: The genre or category to which the book belongs. gross sales: The total sales revenue generated by each book. publisher revenue: The revenue earned by publishers from selling each book. sale price: The price at which each copy of a book is sold. sales rank: A numeric value indicating a book's rank based on its sales performance in comparison to other books within its category (genre). units sold : Total number of copies sold for each specific title. Understanding Numeric and Textual Data:Numeric columns in this dataset include Publishing Year  Author_Rating  Book_average_rating  Book_ratings_count gross sales publisher revenue sale price sales rank and units sold; these provide quantitative insights that can be used for statistical analysis and comparisons. Additionally the columns 'Author' 'Book Name' and 'genre' contain textual data that provides descriptive elements such as authors' names and categorization genres. Exploring Relationships Between Data Points:By combining different column values or comparing them against one another you can discover interesting patterns and insights: You can analyze how the publishing year influences book sales or average ratings. Explore the relationship between an author's rating and their book's average rating or sales performance. Investigate if certain genres tend to have higher ratings or sales ranks. Determine how book pricing affects gross sales or units sold. Data Cleaning and Preparation:Before utilizing this dataset  it is crucial to ensure its cleanliness and accuracy.

Social media has emerged as a prevalent venue for discussing diverse topics  including religion which frequently result in debates. These debates often fuel animosity  incite violence  and spread life-threatening messages that disrupt societal peace and security. To address this challenge  we developed a novel Bengali dataset  ALERT  accompanied by English translations  to identify and classify religious aggression in texts. The dataset was obtained from several online platforms  including Facebook  YouTube  blogs  online news portals  and group discussions. We executed multiple stages for data preprocessing  including the elimination of duplicates  special characters  emoji to improve the coherence of the dataset. Each instance in the dataset was annotated by two of the lists of four annotators with diverse academic  religious  and racial backgrounds  with any discrepancies resolved by expert review. The ALERT dataset is a collection of 4 003 Bangla texts categorized as

The dataset consists of 3 168 recorded voice samples  collected from male and female speakers. The voice samples are pre-processed by acoustic analysis in R using the seewave and tuneR packages  with an analyzed frequency range of 0hz-280hz (human vocal range). The following acoustic properties of each voice are measured and included within the CSV: 50% / 50% 97% / 98% 96% / 97% 100% / 98% 100% / 99% 100% / 99% An original analysis of the data-set can be found in the following article: Identifying the Gender of a Voice using Machine Learning The best model achieves 99% accuracy on the test set. According to a CART model  it appears that looking at the mean fundamental frequency might be enough to accurately classify a voice. However  some male voices use a higher frequency  even though their resonance differs from female voices  and may be incorrectly classified as female. To the human ear  there is apparently more than simple frequency  that determines a voice's gender. Mean fundamental frequency appears to be an indicator of voice gender  with a threshold of 140hz separating male from female classifications.

The task on the dataset is to classify the illicit and licit nodes in the graph. If you make use of the Elliptic Data Set in your research  please consider citing: This anonymized data set is a transaction graph collected from the Bitcoin blockchain. A node in the graph represents a transaction  an edge can be viewed as a flow of Bitcoins between one transaction and the other. Each node has 166 features and has been labeled as being created by a ""licit""  ""illicit"" or ""unknown"" entity. The graph is made of 203 769 nodes and 234 355 edges. Two percent (4 545) of the nodes are labelled class1 (illicit). Twenty-one percent (42 019) are labelled class2 (licit). The remaining transactions are not labelled with regard to licit versus illicit. There are 166 features associated with each node. Due to intellectual property issues  we cannot provide an exact description of all the features in the dataset. There is a time step associated to each node  representing a measure of the time when a transaction was broadcasted to the Bitcoin network. The time steps  running from 1 to 49  are evenly spaced with an interval of about two weeks. Each time step contains a single connected component of transactions that appeared on the blockchain within less than three hours between each other; there are no edges connecting the different time steps. The first 94 features represent local information about the transaction ‚Äì including the time step described above  number of inputs/outputs  transaction fee  output volume and aggregated figures such as average BTC received (spent) by the inputs/outputs and average number of incoming (outgoing) transactions associated with the inputs/outputs. The remaining 72 features are aggregated features  obtained using transaction information one-hop backward/forward from the center node - giving the maximum  minimum  standard deviation and correlation coefficients of the neighbour transactions for the same information data (number of inputs/outputs  transaction fee  etc.).

The opposite is true. In fact  the share of people living in extreme poverty across the world has been declining for two centuries and in the last 20 years this positive development has been faster than ever before (see our work on Poverty). For the recent era it doesn't even matter what poverty line you choose  the share of people below any poverty line has fallen (see here). There are some people who answered the question correctly: every fifth person knows that poverty is falling. But it‚Äôs interesting that the share of correct answers differs substantially across countries. The countries I marked with a star are those that were a low-income or lower-middle-income countries a generation ago (in 1990). In these poorer countries more people understand how global poverty has changed. People in richer countries on the other hand ‚Äì in which the majority of the population escaped extreme poverty some generations ago ‚Äì have a very wrong perception about what is happening to global poverty.

Detection of the cervical cancer cell has played a very important role in clinical practice. The SIPaKMeD Database consists of 4049 images of isolated cells that have been manually cropped from 966 cluster cell images of Pap smear slides. These images were acquired through a CCD camera adapted to an optical microscope. The cell images are divided into five categories containing normal  abnormal and benign cells. IEEE International Conference on Image Processing (ICIP) 2018  Athens  Greece  7-10 October 2018. CERVICAL Cancer is an increasing health problem and an important cause of mortality in women worldwide. Cervical cancer is a cancer is grow in the tissue of the cervix . It is due to the abnormal growth of cell that are spread to the other part of the body.Automatic detection technique are used for cervical abnormality to detect Precancerous cell or cancerous cell than no pathologist are required for manually detection process.

Majority of these customers are liability customers (depositors) with varying size of deposits. The number of customers who are also borrowers (asset customers) is quite small  and the bank is interested in expanding this base rapidly to bring in more loan business and in the process  earn more through the interest on loans. In particular  the management wants to explore ways of converting its liability customers to personal loan customers (while retaining them as depositors). A campaign that the bank ran last year for liability customers showed a healthy conversion rate of over 9% success. This has encouraged the retail marketing department to devise campaigns to better target marketing to increase the success ratio with a minimal budget. The department wants to build a model that will help them identify the potential customers who have a higher probability of purchasing the loan. This will increase the success ratio while at the same time reduce the cost of the campaign. Column descriptions

""Crypto"" is a shorthand term for ""cryptocurrency "" which is a type of digital currency that uses cryptography to secure and verify transactions and to control the creation of new units. Cryptocurrencies are decentralized  meaning they are not controlled by a central authority such as a government or financial institution. Instead  they rely on a decentralized ledger called a blockchain  which is maintained by a network of users. The most well-known cryptocurrency is Bitcoin  which was created in 2009. Since then  thousands of other cryptocurrencies have been created  each with its own unique features and use cases. Some popular cryptocurrencies include Ethereum  Litecoin  and Ripple. Cryptocurrencies have become increasingly popular in recent years  as they offer several advantages over traditional currencies. For example  they allow for faster and cheaper international transactions  as well as increased privacy and security. However  they also come with their own set of risks and challenges  including volatility and regulatory uncertainty."

Derived from a simulator named PaySim  which utilizes aggregated data from actual financial logs of a mobile money service in an African country  this dataset aims to fill the gap in publicly available financial datasets for fraud detection studies. It encompasses a variety of transaction types including CASH-IN  CASH-OUT  DEBIT  PAYMENT  and TRANSFER over a simulated period of 30 days  providing a comprehensive environment for evaluating fraud detection methodologies. By addressing the intrinsic privacy concerns associated with financial transactions  this dataset offers a unique resource for researchers and analysts in the field of financial security and fraud detection  scaled to 1/4 of the original dataset size for efficient use within the Kaggle platform. Please note that transactions marked as fraudulent have been nullified  emphasizing the importance of non-balance columns for fraud analysis. This dataset is a contribution to the field from the ""Scalable resource-efficient systems for big data analytics"" project  funded by the Knowledge Foundation in Sweden. PaySim synthesizes mobile money transactions using data derived from a month's worth of financial logs from a mobile money service operating in an African country. These logs were provided by a multinational company that offers this financial service across more than 14 countries globally. This synthetic dataset has been scaled to one-quarter the size of the original dataset and is specifically tailored for Kaggle. Important Note: Transactions identified as fraudulent are annulled. Hence  for fraud detection analysis  the following columns should not be utilized: oldbalanceOrg  newbalanceOrig  oldbalanceDest  newbalanceDest. This dataset has been generated through multiple runs of the PaySim simulator  each simulating a month of real-time transactions over 744 steps. Each run produced approximately 24 million financial records across the five transaction categories. This project is part of the ""Scalable resource-efficient systems for big data analytics"" research  supported by the Knowledge Foundation (grant: 20140032) in Sweden.

In this dataset  the images are represented as strings of pixel values intrain.csvandtest.csv.  Often  it is beneficial for image data to be in an image format rather than a string format.  Therefore  I have converted the aforementioned datasets from text in .csv files to organized .jpg files. This dataset is composed of four files: As previously mentioned  all data presented here is simply a cleaned version of the data presented in Kaggle'sDigit Recognizercompetition.  The division of the MNIST dataset into training and test sets exactly mirrors that presented in the competition. I created this dataset when exploring TensorFlow's Inception model.  Inception is a massive CNN built by Google to compete in the ImageNet competition.  By way of Transfer Learning  the final layer of Inception can be retrained  rendering the model useful for general classification tasks.  In retraining the model  .jpg images must be used  thereby necessitating to the creation of this dataset. My hope in experimenting with Inception was to achieve an accuracy of around 98.5% or higher on the MNIST dataset.  Unfortunately  the maximum accuracy I reached with Inception was only 95.314%.  If you are interested in my code for said attempt  it is available on my GitHub repositoryKaggle MNIST Inception CNN. To learn more about retraining Inception  check outTensorFlow for Poets.

The two datasets are related to red and white variants of the Portuguese ""Vinho Verde"" wine. The reference [Cortez et al.  2009]. Due to privacy and logistic issues  only physicochemical (inputs) and sensory (the output) variables are available (e.g. there is no data about grape types  wine brand  wine selling price  etc.). These datasets can be viewed as classification or regression tasks. The classes are ordered and not balanced (e.g. there are munch more normal wines than excellent or poor ones). Outlier detection algorithms could be used to detect the few excellent or poor wines. Also  we are not sure if all input variables are relevant. So it could be interesting to test feature selection methods. Two datasets were combined and few values were randomly removed.

This data set can be used to illustrate multiple regression techniques. Accurate measurement of body fat is inconvenient/costly and it is desirable to have easy methods of estimating body fat that are not inconvenient/costly. The variables listed below  from left to right  are: (Measurement standards are apparently those listed in Benhke and Wilmore (1974)  pp. 45-48 where  for instance  the abdomen 2 circumference is measured ""laterally  at the level of the iliac crests  and anteriorly  at the umbilicus"".) These data are used to produce the predictive equations for lean body weight given in the abstract ""Generalized body composition prediction equation for men using simple measurement techniques""  K.W. Penrose  A.G. Nelson  A.G. Fisher  FACSM  Human Performance Research Center  Brigham Young University  Provo  Utah  84602 as listed inMedicine and Science in Sports and Exercise  vol. 17  no. 2  April 1985  p. 189. (The predictive equation were obtained from the first 143 of the 252 cases that are listed below). A variety of popular health books suggest that the readers assess their health  at least in part  by estimating their percentage of body fat. In Bailey (1994)  for instance  the reader can estimate body fat from tables using their age and various skin-fold measurements obtained by using a caliper. Other texts give predictive equations for body fat using body circumference measurements (e.g. abdominal circumference) and/or skin-fold measurements. See  for instance  Behnke and Wilmore (1974)  pp. 66-67; Wilmore (1976)  p. 247; or Katch and McArdle (1977)  pp. 120-132). The percentage of body fat for an individual can be estimated once body density has been determined. Folks (e.g. Siri (1956)) assume that the body consistsof two components - lean body tissue and fat tissue. Letting: we have: D = 1/[(A/a) + (B/b)] solving for B we find: B = (1/D)*[ab/(a-b)] - [b/(a-b)]. Using the estimates a=1.10 gm/cm^3 and b=0.90 gm/cm^3 (see Katch and McArdle (1977)  p. 111 or Wilmore (1976)  p. 123) we come up with ""Siri's equation"": Percentage of Body Fat (i.e. 100*B) = 495/D - 450. Volume  and hence body density  can be accurately measured a variety of ways. The technique of underwater weighing ""computes body volume as the difference between body weight measured in air and weight measured during water submersion. In other words  body volume is equal to the loss of weight inwater with the appropriate temperature correction for the water's density"" (Katch and McArdle (1977)  p. 113). Using this technique  Body Density = WA/[(WA-WW)/c.f. - LV] where: (Katch and McArdle (1977)  p. 115). Other methods of determining body volume are given in Behnke and Wilmore (1974)  p. 22 ff.

Metadata Collaborators Authors Coverage DOI Citation Provenance License Expected Update Frequency Activity Overview Views Downloads Engagement Comments Top Contributors Detail View Related Notebooks Similar Datasets,"Having seen multiple datasets related to face mask detection on Kaggle  one dataset which stood out contained 3 classes (with mask  without a mask  and wearing mask incorrectly)  unfortunately  the dataset was highly imbalanced and uncleaned. So to improve this dataset  images had to be augmented in such a way that each class has an equal distribution of images and removing noisy images which could be considered as outliers. Thus this dataset that I've created is a combination of an existing dataset that has been cleaned and equally distributed across each class. The dataset contains 3 folders labeled as to which class they belong to. the 3 classes are ""with_mask""  ""withou_mask""  and ""mask_weared_incorrect"". Each folder holds 2994 images of people that belong to such a labeled class. I would like to acknowledge the usage of those 2 datasets: Using the above-mentioned datasets  data was manually extracted from both datasets in such a way that the new dataset is equally distributed and contains good quality samples without noise."

Metadata Collaborators Authors Coverage DOI Citation Provenance License Expected Update Frequency Activity Overview Views Downloads Engagement Comments Top Contributors Detail View Related Notebooks,"The 3rd Automatic Speaker Verification Spoofing and Countermeasures Challenge database This is a database used for the Third Automatic Speaker Verification Spoofing and Countermeasuers Challenge  for short  ASVspoof 2019 (http://www.asvspoof.org) organized by Junichi Yamagishi  Massimiliano Todisco  Md Sahidullah  H√©ctor Delgado  Xin Wang  Nicholas Evans  Tomi Kinnunen  Kong Aik Lee  Ville Vestman  and Andreas Nautsch in 2019. The ASVspoof challenge aims to encourage further progress through (i) the collection and distribution of a standard dataset with varying spoofing attacks implemented with multiple  diverse algorithms and (ii) a series of competitive evaluations for automatic speaker verification. The ASVspoof 2019 challenge follows on from three special sessions on spoofing and countermeasures for automatic speaker verification held during INTERSPEECH 2013 [1]  2015 [2]  and 2017 [3]. While the first edition in 2013 was targeted mainly at increasing awareness of the spoofing problem  the 2015 edition included the first challenge on the topic  accompanied by commonly defined evaluation data  metrics and protocols. The task in ASVspoof 2015 was to design countermeasure solutions capable of discriminating between bona fide (genuine) speech and spoofed speech produced using either text-to-speech (TTS) or voice conversion (VC) systems. The ASVspoof 2017 challenge focused on the design of countermeasures aimed at detecting replay spoofing attacks that could  in principle  be implemented by anyone using common consumer-grade devices. The ASVspoof 2019 challenge extends the previous challenge in several directions. The 2019 edition is the first to focus on countermeasures for all three major attack types  namely those stemming from TTS  VC and replay spoofing attacks. Advances with regards to the 2015 edition include the addition of up-to-date TTS and VC systems that draw upon substantial progress made in both fields during the last four years. ASVspoof 2019 thus aims to determine whether the advances in TTS and VC technology post a greater threat to automatic speaker verification and the reliability of spoofing countermeasures. Advances with regards to the 2017 edition concern the use of a far more controlled evaluation setup for the assessment of replay spoofing countermeasures. Whereas the 2017 challenge was created from the recordings of real replayed spoofing attacks  the use of an uncontrolled setup made results somewhat difficult to analyse. A controlled setup  in the form of replay attacks simulated using a range of real replay devices and carefully controlled acoustic conditions is adopted in ASVspoof 2019 with the aim of bringing new insights into the replay spoofing problem. Last but not least  the 2019 edition aligns ASVspoof more closely with the field of automatic speaker verification. Whereas the 2015 and 2017 editions focused on the development and assessment of stand-alone countermeasures  ASVspoof 2019 adopts for the first time a new ASV-centric metric in the form of the tandem decision cost function (t-DCF) [4]. The ASVspoof 2019 database encompasses two partitions for the assessment of logical access (LA) and physical access (PA) scenarios. Both are derived from the VCTK base corpus [5] which includes speech data captured from 107 speakers (46 males  61 females). Both LA and PA databases are themselves partitioned into three datasets  namely training  development and evaluation which comprise the speech from 20 (8 male  12 female)  10 (4 male  6 female) and 48 (21 male  27 female) speakers respectively. The three partitions are disjoint in terms of speakers  and the recording conditions for all source data are identical. While the training and development sets contain spoofing attacks generated with the same algorithms/conditions (designated as known attacks)  the evaluation set also contains attacks generated with different algorithms/conditions (designated as unknown attacks). Reliable spoofing detection performance therefore calls for systems that generalise well to previously-unseen spoofing attacks. Full descriptions are available in the ASVspoof 2019 evaluation plan [6]. Below are some details about the database: Training and development data for the LA scenario are included in 'ASVspoof2019_LA_train'  ' ASVspoof2019_LA_dev'. Training dataset contains audio files with known ground-truth  which can be used to train systems to distinguish genuine and spoofed speech. The development dataset contains audio files with known ground-truth which can be used for the development of spoofing detection algorithms. Likewise  training and development data for the PA scenario are included in 'ASVspoof2019_PA_train'  ' ASVspoof2019_PA_dev'. Evaluation data for LA and PA are available in 'ASVspoof2019_LA_eval'  and 'ASVspoof2019_PA_eval'  respectively. Dev and eval enrollment data for ASV are available in 'ASVspoof2019_{LA PA}dev' and 'ASVspoof2019{LA PA}_eval'  respectively. Protocol and keys are available in 'ASVspoof2019_LA_{cm asv}protocols'  and ASVspoof2019_PA{cm asv}_protocols  respectively. Additional README.LA.txt files and README.pA.txt are included in packages. They are the extended version of ASVspoof2019_{LA PA}_instructions_v1.txt originally used for the challenge to explain the database. About how to compute the EERs and t-DCF  please refer the evaluation plan included in this repository.

It is more difficult to predict G3 without G2 and G1  but such prediction is much more useful (see paper source for more details). More

Metadata Collaborators Authors Coverage DOI Citation Provenance License Expected Update Frequency Activity Overview Views Downloads Engagement Comments Top Contributors Detail View Similar Datasets,Description Between September 2021 and September 2023  an extensive dataset of fetal ultrasound images was meticulously compiled. The study featured 169 subjects  each contributing a variable number of fetal abdomen circumference (AC) images  totaling nearly 1500 images. Eligible participants were term pregnant women aged 18 years or older  either in labor or scheduled for delivery at the Maternity of University Hospital Polydoro Ernani de S√£o Thiago in Florian√≥polis  Santa Catarina  Brazil. This encompassed patients scheduled for labor induction  cesarean section  and those facing pregnancy complications  such as the rupture of membranes  gestational diabetes  pre-eclampsia  and intrauterine growth restriction. Non-eligible cases included pre-term pregnancies  multiple pregnancies  and pregnancies with fetal structural or chromosomal anomalies. The gestational age for all pregnancies was determined based on the earliest ultrasound examination. The study received ethical approval from the Ethics Committee in Human Research at the authors' institution  UNIVERSIDADE FEDERAL DE SANTA CATARINA ‚Äì UFSC  with approval number 4.971.754. All eligible participants were informed about the study's objectives and provided written consent. Expert clinicians used a standardized acquisition protocol to obtain ultrasound images. A common axial section of the fetal AC was captured  with measurements taken at the widest part of the fetal abdomen  spanning the liver. This section encompassed the fetal stomach  aorta artery  spine  and intrahepatic portion of the umbilical vein. Ultrasound images were acquired using Siemens Acuson  Voluson 730 (GE Healthcare Ultrasound)  or Philips-EPIQ Elite (Philips Healthcare Ultrasound) equipment  equipped with 2‚Äì9 MHz curved linear transducers. For validation  the ultrasound presets excluded post-processing options such as image smoothing  zoom  calipers  pointers  or Doppler measurements. Tissue harmonic imaging and adjustments to settings like frequency  gain  and focus were at the discretion of the performing physician. Images were digitally stored in the original Digital Imaging and Communication in Medicine (DICOM) format for offline analysis. A rigorous quality control process  overseen by two team members  ensured that images with calipers or evident acoustic shadows from bony structures were excluded. Only images meeting these strict quality criteria proceeded to the next phase. Expert clinicians utilized specialized software  specifically version 5.2.2 of 3D Slicer  to process selected DICOM images. This software streamlined the segmentation of abdominal structures  emphasizing key components like the abdominal aorta artery  intrahepatic umbilical vein  stomach  and maximizing liver area for in-depth analysis.

Metadata Collaborators Authors Coverage DOI Citation Provenance License Expected Update Frequency Activity Overview Views Downloads Engagement Comments Top Contributors Detail View Related Notebooks Similar Datasets,Common Voice is a corpus of speech data read by users on the Common Voice website (http://voice.mozilla.org/)  and based upon text from a number of public domain sources like user submitted blog posts  old books  movies  and other public speech corpora. Its primary purpose is to enable the training and testing of automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems. The corpus is split into several parts for your convenience. The subsets with ‚Äúvalid‚Äù in their name are audio clips that have had at least 2 people listen to them  and the majority of those listeners say the audio matches the text. The subsets with ‚Äúinvalid‚Äù in their name are clips that have had at least 2 listeners  and the majority say the audio doesnotmatch the clip. All other clips  ie. those with fewer than 2 votes  or those that have equal valid and invalid votes  have ‚Äúother‚Äù in their name. The ‚Äúvalid‚Äù and ‚Äúother‚Äù subsets are further divided into 3 groups: Each subset of data has a corresponding csv file with the following naming convention: ‚Äúcv-{type}-{group}.csv‚Äù Here ‚Äútype‚Äù can be one of {valid  invalid  other}  and ‚Äúgroup‚Äù can be one of {dev  train  test}. Note  the invalid set is not divided into groups. Each row of a csv file represents a single audio clip  and contains the following information: The audio clips for each subset are stored as mp3 files in folders with the same naming conventions as it‚Äôs corresponding csv file. So  for instance  all audio data from the valid train set will be kept in the folder ‚Äúcv-valid-train‚Äù alongside the ‚Äúcv-valid-train.csv‚Äù metadata file.

The datasets provided include the players data for the Career Mode from FIFA 15 to FIFA 21 (""players_21.csv""). The data allows multiple comparison of the same players across the last 7 version of the videogame. Some ideas of possible analysis: Historical comparison between Messi and Ronaldo (what skill attributes changed the most during time - compared to real-life stats); Ideal budget to create a competitive team (at the level of top n teams in Europe) and at which point the budget does not allow to buy significantly better players for the 11-men lineup. An extra is the same comparison with the Potential attribute for the lineup instead of the Overall attribute; Sample analysis of top n% players (e.g. top 5% of the player) to see if some important attributes as Agility or BallControl or Strength have been popular or not acroos the FIFA versions. An example would be seeing that the top 5% players of FIFA 20 are more fast (higher Acceleration and Agility) compared to FIFA 15. The trend of attributes is also an important indication of how some attributes are necessary for players to win games (a version with more top 5% players with high BallControl stats would indicate that the game is more focused on the technique rather than the physicial aspect). Feel free to use the available dataset the way you prefer and do not hesitate to flag additional files (player images - datasets prior FIFA 15) that could be implemented to the existing CSV files.

How would you describe this dataset? Metadata Collaborators Authors Coverage DOI Citation Provenance License Expected Update Frequency Activity Overview Views Downloads Engagement Comments Top Contributors Detail View Related Notebooks Similar Datasets,Flood detection refers to identifying  monitoring  and alerting authorities or individuals about the presence or likelihood of flooding in a particular area. It involves using various technologies and methods to detect  predict  and mitigate the impacts of floods. Flood prediction is a critical area of research due to its significant impact on human life  infrastructure  and the environment. Accurate flood prediction models can aid in disaster preparedness and risk management  reducing the adverse effects of floods. IMPORTANT FEATURES OF DATASET:The dataset used for this analysis comprises numerous features  providing essential insights into environmental and human factors that influence flood occurrence and severity. These features include: 1. MonsoonIntensity:Higher volumes of rain during monsoons increase the probability of floods.2. TopographyDrainage:The drainage capacity based on the region's topography. Efficient drainage can help drain rainwater and reduce the risk of floods.3. RiverManagement:The quality and effectiveness of river management practices. Proper river management  including dredging and bank maintenance  can improve water flow and reduce floods.4. Deforestation:The extent of deforestation in the area.* Deforestation reduces the soil's ability to absorb water  increasing surface runoff and the risk of floods.5. Urbanization: The level of urbanization in the region. Urban areas have impermeable surfaces (asphalt  concrete)  which reduce water infiltration  raising the risk of floods.6. ClimateChange:The impact of climate change on the region. Climate change can lead to more extreme precipitation patterns  including torrential rains that can cause floods.7. DamsQuality:The quality and maintenance status of dams. Well-maintained dams can control floods  and dams with structural problems can break and cause catastrophic floods.**8. Siltation: ** The extent of siltation in rivers and reservoirs. The accumulation of sediments in rivers (siltation) reduces drainage capacity and increases the risk of floods.9. Agricultural Practices:The types and sustainability of agricultural practices. The intensification of agriculture can lead to deforestation  excessive use of fertilizers and pesticides  and inappropriate irrigation practices  reducing soil biodiversity and increasing the risk of floods.10. Encroachments:The degree of encroachment on flood plains and natural waterways. Construction in flood-prone areas impedes the natural flow of water and increases the risk of floods.**11. IneffectiveDisasterPreparedness: ** The lack of emergency plans  warning systems  and simulations increases the negative impact of floods.12. DrainageSystems:Well-maintained and adequately sized drainage systems help drain rainwater and reduce the risk of floods.13. CoastalVulnerability:Low-lying coastal areas are prone to flooding from storm surges and sea level rise.14. Landslides:Steep slopes and unstable soils are more prone to landslides.15. Watersheds:Regions with more watersheds may have a higher or lower risk of flooding  depending on various factors.16. DeterioratingInfrastructure:Clogged culverts  damaged drainage channels  and other deficient infrastructure can increase the risk of floods.17. PopulationScore:Densely populated areas can suffer more severe losses.18. WetlandLoss:Wetlands act as natural sponges  absorbing excess water and helping to prevent floods.19. InadequatePlanning:Urban planning that does not consider the risk of flooding increases the vulnerability of communities.20. PoliticalFactors:Factors such as corruption and a lack of political will to invest in drainage infrastructure can make it difficult to manage flood risk.10. FloodProbability:The overall probability of flooding in the region. This is the target variable for predictive analysis. This is the target Variable.

It is one of the leading causes of blindness worldwide  especially among older adults. The disease often develops slowly and without warning signs  making early detection crucial. There are several types of glaucoma  with open-angle and angle-closure being the most common. Open-angle glaucoma progresses gradually  while angle-closure can occur suddenly and cause severe pain. Symptoms  when present  may include blurred vision  halos around lights  and eye redness. Regular eye exams are essential for early diagnosis and management. Treatment options include eye drops  oral medications  laser therapy  and surgery. Although there is no cure  proper treatment can slow or prevent vision loss. Protecting eye health through regular checkups is key to managing glaucoma effectively Source: Raw Data: Other Information:https://www.kaggle.com/deathtrooper/datasetshttps://www.kaggle.com/datasets/deathtrooper/multichannel-glaucoma-benchmark-datasethttps://www.kaggle.com/datasets/deathtrooper/glaucoma-dataset-eyepacs-airogs-light-v2https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/deathtrooper/eyepacs-airogs-light **More Dataset:: **https://www.kaggle.com/shuvokumarbasak4004/datasets ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶..Note for Researchers Using the dataset‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ If you use this dataset for your research or academic purposes  please ensure to cite this dataset appropriately.

Liver cancer is thefifthmost commonly occurring cancer in men and theninthmost commonly occurring cancer in women. There were over840 000 new cases in 2018. The liver is a common site of primary or secondary tumor development. Due to their heterogeneous and diffusive shape  automatic segmentation of tumor lesions is very challenging. In light of that  we encourage the development of automatic segmentation algorithms to segment liver lesions in contrast¬≠-enhanced abdominal CT scans. The data and segmentations are provided by various clinical sites around the world.This dataset was extracted from LiTS ‚Äì Liver Tumor Segmentation Challenge (LiTS17) organised in conjunction with ISBI 2017 and MICCAI 2017.

Irrelevant images as pointed out from the discussion forums were also removed to ensure the quality of the dataset. Most life forms began their evolution in aquatic environments. About 90% of the world's living space is provided by the oceans in terms of volume. Fish  which are only found in water  are the first known vertebrates. Some of these transformed into amphibians  which dwell both on land and in water for parts of the day. A few subgroups of one group of amphibians  which also included sea turtles  seals  manatees  and whales  developed into reptiles and mammals. Some underwater habitats are supported by plant life that grows in the water  such as kelp and other algae. The base of the ocean food chain is made up primarily of phytoplankton  which are important primary producers.Source The dataset contains different images of marine animals. Some images were taken from pixabay.com and requires no license or attribution when used. Other images were taken from flickr.com where attribution to the original authors will be required when used commercially. Currently  there are19different classes available and may be extended further in the future.

Several different factors can affect laptop computer prices. These factors include the brand of computer and the number of options and add-ons included in the computer package. In addition  the amount of memory and the speed of the processor can also affect pricing. Though less common  some consumers spend additional money to purchase a computer based on the overall ‚Äúlook‚Äù and design of the system. In many cases  name brand computers are more expensive than generic versions. This price increase often has more to do with name recognition than any actual superiority of the product. One major difference between name brand and generic systems is that in most cases  name brand computers offer better warranties than generic versions. Having the option of returning a computer that is malfunctioning is often enough of an incentive to encourage many consumers to spend more money. Functionality is an important factor in determining laptop computer prices. A computer with more memory often performs better for a longer time than a computer with less memory. In addition  hard drive space is also crucial  and the size of the hard drive usually affects pricing. Many consumers may also look for digital video drivers and other types of recording devices that may affect the laptop computer prices. Most computers come with some software pre-installed. In most cases  the more software that is installed on a computer  the more expensive it is. This is especially true if the installed programs are from well-established and recognizable software publishers. Those considering purchasing a new laptop computer should be aware that many of the pre-installed programs may be trial versions only  and will expire within a certain time period. In order to keep the programs  a code will need to be purchased  and then a permanent version of the software can be downloaded. -Many consumers who are purchasing a new computer are buying an entire package. In addition to the computer itself  these systems typically include a monitor  keyboard  and mouse. Some packages may even include a printer or digital camera. The number of extras included in a computer package usually affects laptop computer prices.Some industry leaders in computer manufacturing make it a selling point to offer computers in sleek styling and in a variety of colors. They may also offer unusual or contemporary system design. Though this is less important to many consumers  for those who do value ‚Äúlooks ‚Äù this type of system may be well worth the extra cost.

Although rich and poor people alike eat rice in low-income countries  the poorest people consume relatively little wheat and are therefore deeply affected by the cost and availability of rice. In many Asian countries  rice is the fundamental and generally irreplaceable staple  especially of the poor. For the extreme poor in Asia  who live on less than $1.25 a day  rice accounts for nearly half of their food expenditures and a fifth of total household expenditures  on average. This group alone annually spends the equivalent of $62 billion (purchasing power parity) on rice. Rice is critical to food security for many of the world‚Äôs poor people. ~ Quote fromricepedia.org This dataset contains 120 jpg images of disease infected rice leaves.

Breast cancer is the most frequent cancer among women  impacting 2.1 million women each year. Breast cancer causes the greatest number of cancer-related deaths among women. In 2018 alone  it is estimated that 627 000 women died from breast cancer. The most important part of a process of clinical decision-making in patients with cancers  in general  is the accurate estimation of prognosis and survival duration. Breast cancer patients with the same stage of the disease and the same clinical characteristics can have different treatment responses and overall survival  but why? Cancers are associated with genetic abnormalities. Gene expression measures the level of gene activity in a tissue and gives information about its complex activities. Comparing the genes expressed in normal and diseased tissue can bring better insights into the cancer prognosis and outcomes. Using machine learning techniques on genetic data has the potentials of giving the correct estimation of survival time and can prevent unnecessary surgical and treatment procedures. The Molecular Taxonomy of Breast Cancer International Consortium (METABRIC) database is a Canada-UK Project which contains targeted sequencing data of 1 980 primary breast cancer samples. Clinical and genomic data was downloaded fromcBioPortal. The dataset was collected by Professor Carlos Caldas from Cambridge Research Institute and Professor Sam Aparicio from the British Columbia Cancer Centre in Canada and published on Nature Communications(Pereira et al.  2016). It was also featured in multiple papers including Nature and others: The genetics part of the dataset contains m-RNA levels z-score for 331 genes  and mutation for 175 genes. From CBioPortal: The DNA molecules attached to each slide act as probes to detect gene expression  which is also known as the transcriptome or the set of messenger RNA (mRNA) transcripts expressed by a group of genes. To perform a microarray analysis  mRNA molecules are typically collected from both an experimental sample and a reference sample. For mRNA expression data  The calculations of the relative expression of an individual gene and tumor to the gene's expression distribution in a reference population is done. That reference population is all samples in the study . The returned value indicates the number of standard deviations away from the mean of expression in the reference population (Z-score). This measure is useful to determine whether a gene is up- or down-regulated relative to the normal samples or all other tumor samples. The formula is : z = (expression in tumor sample - mean expression in reference sample) / standard deviation of expression in reference sample

The UEFA Champions League is an annual club football competition organised by the Union of European Football Associations and contested by top-division European clubs  deciding the competition winners through a round robin group stage to qualify for a double-legged knockout format  and a single leg final. The 2022 UEFA Champions League Final was the final match of the 2021‚Äì22 UEFA Champions League  the 67th season of Europe's premier club football tournament organised by UEFA  and the 30th season since it was renamed from the European Champion Clubs' Cup to the UEFA Champions League. It was played at the Stade de France in Saint-Denis  France  on 28 May 2022  between English club Liverpool and Spanish club Real Madrid. It was the third time the two sides have met in the European Cup final  after 1981 and 2018  the third final held here  after the 2000 and 2006 finals  and the first time the same two teams have met in three finals. This was the first final to be played in front of a full attendance since the 2019 final  as the previous two finals were affected by the COVID-19 pandemic.The final was originally scheduled to be played at the Allianz Arena in Munich  Germany. After the postponement and relocation of the 2020 final  the final hosts were shifted back a year  so the 2022 final was given to the Krestovsky Stadium in Saint Petersburg. Following the Russian invasion of Ukraine on 24 February  UEFA called an extraordinary meeting of the executive committee  where it was expected to officially pull the match out of Russia.[8][9] A day later  it announced the final would move to the Stade de France in Saint-Denis  located just north of Paris. Real Madrid won the match 1‚Äì0 via a 59th-minute goal from Vin√≠cius J√∫nior for a record-extending 14th title  and their 5th in nine years. As the winners of the 2021‚Äì22 UEFA Champions League  Real Madrid earned the right to play against the winners of the 2021‚Äì22 UEFA Europa League  Eintracht Frankfurt  in the 2022 UEFA Super Cup. Additionally  the winners typically qualify for the annual FIFA Club World Cup. However  the tournament's status remains uncertain  following FIFA's proposal for a format overhaul.

For some subjects  the images were taken at different times  varying the lighting  facial expressions (open / closed eyes  smiling / not smiling) and facial details (glasses / no glasses). All the images were taken against a dark homogeneous background with the subjects in an upright  frontal position (with tolerance for some side movement).The image is quantized to 256 grey levels and stored as unsigned 8-bit integers; the loader will convert these to floating point values on the interval [0  1]  which are easier to work with for many algorithms. The ‚Äútarget‚Äù for this database is an integer from 0 to 39 indicating the identity of the person pictured; however  with only 10 examples per class  this relatively small dataset is more interesting from an unsupervised or semi-supervised perspective. The original dataset consisted of 92 x 112  while the version available here consists of 64x64 images. Credit to AT&T Laboratories Cambridge for images

Automatic checkout (ACO) is one of the critical problems in this area which aims to automatically generate the shopping list from the images of the products to purchase. The main challenge of this problem comes from the large scale and the fine-grained nature of the product categories as well as the difficulty for collecting training images that reflect the realistic checkout scenarios due to continuous update of the products. Despite its significant practical and research value  this problem is not extensively studied in the computer vision community  largely due to the lack of a high-quality dataset. To fill this gap  in this work we propose a new dataset to facilitate relevant research. Our dataset enjoys the following characteristics: (1) It is by far the largest dataset in terms of both product image quantity and product categories. (2) It includes single-product images taken in a controlled environment and multi-product images taken by the checkout system. (3) It provides different levels of annotations for the checkout images. Comparing with the existing datasets  ours is closer to the realistic setting and can derive a variety of research problems. Besides the dataset  we also benchmark the performance on this dataset with various approaches. More details of the dataset can be found viaRPC Dataset Project Page#Dataset. Notice:  We also provide two empty  white board pictures as backgroundhere RPC-dataset has the same data structure as the data struecture ofthe COCO dataset's object detection annotation format. More details of the data format can be found viaKernel: Introduce the RPC-Dataset. RPC-Leaderboard If you have been successful in creating a model based on the training set and it performs well on the validation set  we encourage you to run your model on the test set. Therpctool(in the next section in this project page) will contribute to return the corresponding results of the evaluation metrics. You can submit your results on the RPC leaderboard by creating a new issue. Your results will be ranked in the leaderboard and to benchmark your approach against that of other machine learners.

Credit card data that is available often has significant obfuscation  relatively few transactions  and short time duration.  For example this Kaggle datasethas 284 000 transactions over two days  of which less than 500 are fraudulent.   In addition  all but two columns have had a principal components transformation  which obfuscates true values and makes the column values uncorrelated. The data here has almost no obfuscation and is provided in a CSV file whose schema is described in the first row.  This data has more than 20 million transactions generated from a multi-agent virtual world simulation performed by IBM.  The data covers 2000 (synthetic) consumers resident in the United States  but who travel the world.  The data also covers decades of purchases  and includes multiple cards from many of the consumers. Further details about the generation arehere.   Analyses of the data suggest that it is a reasonable match for  real data in many dimensions  e.g. fraud rates  purchase amounts  Merchant Category Codes (MCCs)  and other metrics.  In addition  all columns except merchant name have their ""natural"" value.  Such natural values can be helpful in feature engineering of models. F1provides a useful score for models predicting whether a particular transaction is fraudulent.  In addition  comparison can be made to the results other fraud detection models  e.g. A broader set of synthetic financial transactions labeled for money laundering is also available on Kaggle: We look forward to models and other analysis of this data.

To provide this efficiency  new methods and technologies are needed for the separation and classification of pistachios. Different pistachio species address different markets  which increases the need for the classification of pistachio species. In this study  it is aimed to develop a classification model different from traditional separation methods  based on image processing and artificial intelligence which are capable to provide the required classification. A computer vision system has been developed to distinguish two different species of pistachios with different characteristics that address different market types. 2148 sample image for these two kinds of pistachios were taken with a high-resolution camera. The image processing techniques  segmentation and feature extraction were applied on the obtained images of the pistachio samples. A pistachio dataset that has sixteen attributes was created. An advanced classifier based on k-NN method  which is a simple and successful classifier  and principal component analysis was designed on the obtained dataset. In this study; a multi-level system including feature extraction  dimension reduction and dimension weighting stages has been proposed. Experimental results showed that the proposed approach achieved a classification success of 94.18%. The presented high-performance classification model provides an important need for the separation of pistachio species and increases the economic value of species. In addition  the developed model is important in terms of its application to similar studies.

(Open Access) ABSTRACT:  Pistachio is a shelled fruit from the anacardiaceae family. The homeland of pistachio is the Middle East. The Kirmizi pistachios and Siirt pistachios are the major types grown and exported in Turkey. Since the prices  tastes  and nutritional values of these types differs  the type of pistachio becomes important when it comes to trade. This study aims to identify these two types of pistachios  which are frequently grown in Turkey  by classifying them via convolutional neural networks. Within the scope of the study  images of Kirmizi and Siirt pistachio types were obtained through the computer vision system. The pre-trained dataset includes a total of 2148 images  1232 of Kirmizi type and 916 of Siirt type. Three different convolutional neural network models were used to classify these images. Models were trained by using the transfer learning method  with AlexNet and the pre-trained models VGG16 and VGG19. The dataset is divided as 80% training and 20% test. As a result of the performed classifications  the success rates obtained from the AlexNet  VGG16  and VGG19 models are 94.42%  98.84%  and 98.14%  respectively. Models‚Äô performances were evaluated through sensitivity  specificity  precision  and F-1 score metrics. In addition  ROC curves and AUC values were used in the performance evaluation. The highest classification success was achieved with the VGG16 model. The obtained results reveal that these methods can be used successfully in the determination of pistachio types.

Food accessibility refers to the access by individuals to adequate resources for acquiring appropriate foods for a nutritious diet. It addresses whether the households or individuals have enough resources to acquire appropriate quantity of quality foods  thus  it encompasses their income  expenditure and buying capacity. There are two aspects of food access ‚Äì the economic and physical access. Economic access refers to factors such as income  poverty and other indicators of buying capacity. Physical access indicators are related to infrastructure and facilities that hasten the access to food. Furthermore  the indicators were grouped into the level of importance which were either key or support. Key indicators are those which best describe the dimension. In the absence of available data for the key indicators  the support indicators will be the alternative for use. Food utilization is one of the three dimensions of food security.  It is defined as the ability of the human body to ingest and metabolize food through adequate diet  clean water  good sanitation and health care to reach a state of nutritional well-being where all physiological needs are met. In this dimension  it is essential to know if the food available in a given period of time had been accessed and well utilized.  A household makes decisions on what food to consume and how to allocate food within the household.  Appropriate food intake is vital for nutritional status of the populace.

These superstores are typically known for their extensive inventory  competitive pricing  and one-stop shopping experience. Analyzing superstore sales data is essential for store owners  managers  and analysts to understand the store's performance  identify trends  and make informed business decisions. Here are some key aspects of superstore sales analysis: Sales Revenue:Tracking the total sales revenue over time provides insights into the overall financial performance of the superstore. It helps identify peak seasons and periods of high or low sales. Sales by Product Category:Analyzing sales by product category (e.g.  electronics  apparel  home goods) helps understand which categories are driving revenue and which may require improvement. Sales by Region:Superstores often have multiple locations. Analyzing sales by region helps identify the best-performing stores and areas for expansion or improvement. Sales by Customer Segments:Understanding sales patterns among different customer segments can inform targeted marketing strategies and customer engagement. Sales Trends:Identifying sales trends over time  such as monthly or seasonal variations  can help in inventory management and marketing planning. Product Performance:Analyzing individual product sales can help identify popular products  slow-moving items  and potential stockouts. Customer Behavior:Studying customer behavior  such as purchase frequency  average transaction value  and repeat purchases  provides insights into customer preferences and loyalty. Promotions and Discounts:Evaluating the impact of promotions and discounts on sales can help optimize marketing strategies. Sales Forecasting:Using historical sales data  superstore owners and managers can forecast future sales  plan inventory levels  and make data-driven decisions. To conduct thorough sales analysis  superstores often use data visualization tools  spreadsheets  or specialized retail analytics software. These tools help present the data in a visually appealing and easy-to-understand format  enabling better decision-making and strategic planning. Additionally  by integrating sales data with other metrics like profitability  inventory turnover  and customer satisfaction  superstore owners can gain a comprehensive view of their business performance."

By providing this data in an easy to visualise format you can gain an insight into how these issues are impacting lives; allowing for a deeper understanding of these conditions and the implications. Through this reflection you may be able to answer some important questions: For more datasets  clickhere. Using this dataset is quite straightforward. Each row of the table contains information about a certain country or region for a certain year. The following columns are provided: Entity (the country or region name)  Code (the code for the country or region)  Year (the year the data was collected) Schizophrenia (% - percentage of people with schizophrenia)  Bipolar Disorder (%) - percentage of people with bipolar disorder) Eating Disorders (%) - Percentage of individuals with disordered eating patterns Anxiety Disorders (%) - Percentage of individuals with anxiety Drug Use Disorders (%) - Percentage figures for those struggling with substance abuse Depression (%) ‚Äì Percentages relating to those struggling with depressive illness Alcohol Use Disorders (%) ‚Äì Percentages relating to those battling alcoholism Using this dataset requires no special skills; however it is best suited for those comfortable navigating spreadsheets and tables as well as analyzing numerical information quickly and accurately. Many software suites like excel are useful here but simple internet searches will reveal free alternatives if your preference is web-based solutions! By piecing together these different columns‚Äô values we can get an idea if prevalence rates across different types of mental illnesses increase or decrease over time. For example we could compare depression levels between 2015 and 2018 by creating two separate sets containing information filtered just within our parameters respectively only reading records from 2015 then 2018). From here we can see whether numbers changed very much or stayed stagnant supefying any sort of patterns that could exist Visualizing the prevalence of mental health disorders - Create a data visualization that compares and contrasts the prevalence of depression  anxiety  bipolar disorder  schizophrenia  eating disorders  alcohol use disorder and drug use disorder across different countries. This could provide insight into global differences in mental health and potential causes of those differences. Mapping depression rates - Create an interactive map that shows both regional and national variations in depression rates within a specific country or region. This would allow people to easily identify areas with higher or lower than average prevalence of depression which could help inform decision-makers when it comes to policy-making related to mental healthcare services provisioning. Developing predictive models for mental health - Use the data from this dataset as part of a larger machine learning project to build predictive models for mental health across countries or regions based on various factors such as demographics  economic indicators etc.  This can be helpful for researchers working on understanding populations‚Äô susceptibility towards developing certain disorders so as to craft appropriate preventive strategies accordingly If you use this dataset in your research  please credit the original authors.Data Source See the dataset description for more information.

On April 15  1912  during her maiden voyage  the Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg  killing 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew. This sensational tragedy shocked the international community and led to better safety regulations for ships.One of the reasons that the shipwreck led to such loss of life was that there were not enough lifeboats for the passengers and crew. Although there was some element of luck involved in surviving the sinking  some groups of people were more likely to survive than others  such as women  children  and the upper-class.In this challenge  we ask you to complete the analysis of what sorts of people were likely to survive. In particular  we ask you to apply the tools of machine learning to predict which passengers survived the tragedy.

Metadata Collaborators Authors Coverage DOI Citation Provenance License Expected Update Frequency Activity Overview Views Downloads Engagement Comments Top Contributors Detail View Related Notebooks Similar Datasets,Cervical Cancer Risk Factors for Biopsy: This Dataset is Obtained from UCI Repository and kindly acknowledged! This file contains a List of Risk Factors for Cervical Cancer leading to a Biopsy Examination! About 11 000 new cases of invasive cervical cancer are diagnosed each year in the U.S. However  the number of new cervical cancer cases has been declining steadily over the past decades. Although it is the most preventable type of cancer  each year cervical cancer kills about 4 000 women in the U.S. and about 300 000 women worldwide. In the United States  cervical cancer mortality rates plunged by 74% from 1955 - 1992 thanks to increased screening and early detection with the Pap test. AGE Fifty percent of cervical cancer diagnoses occur in women ages 35 - 54  and about 20% occur in women over 65 years of age. The median age of diagnosis is 48 years. About 15% of women develop cervical cancer between the ages of 20 - 30. Cervical cancer is extremely rare in women younger than age 20. However  many young women become infected with multiple types of human papilloma virus  which then can increase their risk of getting cervical cancer in the future. Young women with early abnormal changes who do not have regular examinations are at high risk for localized cancer by the time they are age 40  and for invasive cancer by age 50. SOCIOECONOMIC AND ETHNIC FACTORS Although the rate of cervical cancer has declined among both Caucasian and African-American women over the past decades  it remains much more prevalent in African-Americans -- whose death rates are twice as high as Caucasian women. Hispanic American women have more than twice the risk of invasive cervical cancer as Caucasian women  also due to a lower rate of screening. These differences  however  are almost certainly due to social and economic differences. Numerous studies report that high poverty levels are linked with low screening rates. In addition  lack of health insurance  limited transportation  and language difficulties hinder a poor woman‚Äôs access to screening services. HIGH SEXUAL ACTIVITY Human papilloma virus (HPV) is the main risk factor for cervical cancer. In adults  the most important risk factor for HPV is sexual activity with an infected person. Women most at risk for cervical cancer are those with a history of multiple sexual partners  sexual intercourse at age 17 years or younger  or both. A woman who has never been sexually active has a very low risk for developing cervical cancer. Sexual activity with multiple partners increases the likelihood of many other sexually transmitted infections (chlamydia  gonorrhea  syphilis).Studies have found an association between chlamydia and cervical cancer risk  including the possibility that chlamydia may prolong HPV infection. FAMILY HISTORY Women have a higher risk of cervical cancer if they have a first-degree relative (mother  sister) who has had cervical cancer. USE OF ORAL CONTRACEPTIVES Studies have reported a strong association between cervical cancer and long-term use of oral contraception (OC). Women who take birth control pills for more than 5 - 10 years appear to have a much higher risk HPV infection (up to four times higher) than those who do not use OCs. (Women taking OCs for fewer than 5 years do not have a significantly higher risk.) The reasons for this risk from OC use are not entirely clear. Women who use OCs may be less likely to use a diaphragm  condoms  or other methods that offer some protection against sexual transmitted diseases  including HPV. Some research also suggests that the hormones in OCs might help the virus enter the genetic material of cervical cells. HAVING MANY CHILDREN Studies indicate that having many children increases the risk for developing cervical cancer  particularly in women infected with HPV. SMOKING Smoking is associated with a higher risk for precancerous changes (dysplasia) in the cervix and for progression to invasive cervical cancer  especially for women infected with HPV. IMMUNOSUPPRESSION Women with weak immune systems  (such as those with HIV / AIDS)  are more susceptible to acquiring HPV. Immunocompromised patients are also at higher risk for having cervical precancer develop rapidly into invasive cancer. DIETHYLSTILBESTROL (DES) From 1938 - 1971  diethylstilbestrol (DES)  an estrogen-related drug  was widely prescribed to pregnant women to help prevent miscarriages. The daughters of these women face a higher risk for cervical cancer. DES is no longer prsecribed.

As this impurity is measured every hour  if we can predict how much silica (impurity) is in the ore concentrate  we can help the engineers  giving them early information to take actions (empowering!). Hence  they will be able to take corrective actions in advance (reduce impurity  if it is the case) and also help the environment (reducing the amount of ore that goes to tailings as you reduce silica in the ore concentrate). The first column shows time and date range (from march of 2017 until september of 2017). Some columns were sampled every 20 second. Others were sampled on a hourly base. The second and third columns are quality measures of the iron ore pulp right before it is fed into the flotation plant. Column 4 until column 8 are the most important variables that impact in the ore quality in the end of the process. From column 9 until column 22  we can see process data (level and air flow inside the flotation columns  which also impact in ore quality. The last two columns are the final iron ore pulp quality measurement from the lab.Target is to predict the last column  which is the % of silica in the iron ore concentrate. I have been working in this dataset for at least six months and would like to see if the community can help to answer the following questions: Is it possible to predict % Silica Concentrate every minute? How many steps (hours) ahead can we predict % Silica in Concentrate? This would help engineers to act in predictive and optimized way  mitigatin the % of iron that could have gone to tailings. Is it possible to predict % Silica in Concentrate whitout using % Iron Concentrate column (as they are highly correlated)? Research/Conference Papers and Master Thesis:

This information can help assess the severity of congestion and monitor traffic conditions at different times and days of the week. In what cases can it be useful?The dataset is useful in transportation planning  congestion management  and traffic flow analysis. It helps understand vehicle demand  identify congested areas  and inform infrastructure improvements. The dataset enables targeted interventions like signal optimizations and lane adjustments. It allows researchers to study traffic patterns by hour  day  or specific dates and explore correlations with external factors. It supports transportation research on vehicle relationships and traffic behavior. Urban planners can assess traffic impact for zoning and infrastructure decisions. Overall  the dataset empowers stakeholders to make data-driven decisions  enhance urban mobility  and create efficient and sustainable cities. Is there a new update?Yes  in the next update  the dataset will be expanded to include the speed of the cars. Additionally  the data will not be limited to a single route; instead  it will encompass a traffic intersection. This expansion aims to provide a more comprehensive understanding of traffic dynamics and enable better analysis and decision-making for traffic management. The inclusion of speed data will offer insights into the flow and efficiency of vehicles  further enhancing the dataset's value for transportation planning and congestion management efforts. Thanks"

Hence  the entire dataset covers roughly 340 square kilometers. The data is split into a training set of 137 images  a test set of 10 images and a validation set of 4 images. The target maps were obtained by rasterizing building footprints obtained from the OpenStreetMap project. The data was restricted to regions with an average omission noise level of roughly 5% or less. The large amount of high quality building footprint data was possible to collect because the City of Boston contributed building footprints for the entire city to the OpenStreetMap project. The dataset covers mostly urban and suburban areas and buildings of all sizes  including individual houses and garages  are included in the labels. The datasets make use of imagery released by the state ofMassachusetts. All imagery is rescaled to a resolution of 1 pixel per square meter. The target maps for the dataset were generated using data from the  OpenStreetMap project. Target maps for the test and validation portions of the dataset were hand-corrected to make the evaluations more accurate. Referthis thesisfor more information. This dataset is derived fromVolodymyr Mnih'soriginalMassachusetts Buildings Dataset. Massachusetts Roads Dataset & Massachusetts Buildings dataset were introduced in Chapter 6 of hisPhD thesis. If you use this dataset for research purposes you should use the following citation in any resulting publications: @phdthesis{MnihThesis author = {Volodymyr Mnih} title = {Machine Learning for Aerial Image Labeling} school = {University of Toronto} year = {2013}} Rapid advances in Image Understanding using Computer Vision techniques have brought us many state-of-the-art deep learning models across various benchmark datasets. Can we better address the challenges faced by the current models in segmenting buildings from aerial images using the latest methods? Do state-of-the-art methods from other benchmarks work equally well on this data?  Does engineering features specific to buildings datasets allow us to build better models?

Previous studies assess which anatomical parameters of the optic nerve can be predictive of glaucomatous damage  but to date there is no test that by itself has sufficient sensitivity and specificity to diagnose this disease. This work provides a public dataset with medical data and fundus images of both eyes of the same patient. Segmentations of the cup and optic disc  as well as the labeling of the patients based on the evaluation of clinical data are also provided. The dataset has been tested with a neural network to classify healthy and glaucoma patients. Specifically  the ResNet-50 has been used as the basis to classify patients using information from each eye independently as well as using the joint information from both eyes of each patient. Results provide the baseline metrics  with the aim of promoting research in the early detection of glaucoma based on the joint analysis of both eyes of the same patient. Kovalyk  O.

The Hackathon provides students with a chance to build capacity via hands-on ML  learn from one another  and engage in a self-defined project that is meaningful to their careers. Teams must register via Google Form to be eligible for the Hackathon. The Hackathon starts onMonday  November 12  2018and ends onMonday  December 10  2018. Teams have one month to work on a team submission.Teams must do all work within the Kernel editor and set Kernel(s) to public at all times. The freestyle format of hackathons has time and again stimulated groundbreaking and innovative data insights and technologies. The Kaggle University Club Hackathon recreates this environment virtually on our platform. We challenge you tobuild a meaningful project around the UCI Machine Learning - Drug Review Dataset. Teams are free to let their creativity run and propose methods to analyze this dataset and form interesting machine learning models. Machine learning has permeated nearly all fields and disciplines of study. One hot topic is using natural language processing and sentiment analysis to identify  extract  and make use of subjective information. The UCI ML Drug Review dataset provides patient reviews on specific drugs along with related conditions and a 10-star patient rating system reflecting overall patient satisfaction. The data was obtained by crawling online pharmaceutical review sites. This data was published in a study on sentiment analysis of drug experience over multiple facets  ex. sentiments learned on specific aspects such as effectiveness and side effects (see the acknowledgments section to learn more). The sky's the limit here in terms of what your team can do! Teams arefree to add supplementary datasetsin conjunction with the drug review dataset in their Kernel.Discussion is highly encouragedwithin the forum and Slack so everyone can learn from their peers. Here are just a couple ideas as to what youcoulddo with the data: There is no one correct answer to this Hackathon  and teams are free to define the direction of their own project. That being said  there are certain core elements generally found across all outstanding Kernels on the Kaggle platform. The best Kernels are: Teams with top submissions have a chance to receive exclusive Kaggle University Club swag and be featured on our official blog and across social media. IMPORTANT: Teams must set all Kernels to public at all times. This is so we can track each team's progression  but more importantly it encourages collaboration  productive discussion  and healthy inspiration to all teams. It is not so that teams can  simply copycat good ideas. If a team's Kernel isn't their own organic work  it will not be considered a top submission. Teams must come up with a project on their own. The final Kernel submission for the Hackathon must contain the following information: The dataset was originally published on theUCI Machine Learning repository.

The following data contains the information collected from the Mayo Clinic trial in primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) of the liver conducted between 1974 and 1984.  A description of the clinical background for the trial and the covariates recorded here is in Chapter 0  especially Section 0.2 of Fleming and Harrington  CountingProcesses and Survival Analysis  Wiley  1991.  A more extended discussion can be found in Dickson  et al.  Hepatology 10:1-7 (1989) and in Markus  et al.  N Eng J of Med 320:1709-13 (1989). A total of 424 PBC patients  referred to Mayo Clinic during that ten-year interval  met eligibility criteria for the randomized placebo-controlled trial of the drug D-penicillamine. The first 312 cases in the dataset participated in the randomized trial and contain largely complete data.  The additional 112 cases did not participate in the clinical trial but consented to have basic measurements recorded and to be followed for survival.

There are more than 26 million homes for the energy suppliers to get to  with the goal of every home having a smart meter by 2020. This roll out of meter is lead by the European Union who asked all member governments to look at smart meters as part of measures to upgrade our energy supply and tackle climate change. After an initial study  the British government decided to adopt smart meters as part of their plan to update our ageing energy system. In this dataset  you will find arefactorised version of the datafrom the London data store  that contains the energy consumption readings for a sample of 5 567 London Households that took part in the UK Power Networks led Low Carbon London project between November 2011 and February 2014.

In Bangladesh  1.5% of adults suffer from blindness  while 21.6% experience low vision. Therefore  eye disease detection is crucial for preserving vision  preventing blindness  and maintaining overall health. Early detection allows for prompt intervention and treatment  preventing irreversible damage and preserving quality of life. By analyzing the dataset  researchers will be able to identify trends  develop algorithms for diagnosis  assess treatment effectiveness  and inform preventive measures. Currently  computer vision methods show great promise in carrying out classification and detection tasks of this nature. To develop computer vision-based algorithms  an extensive eye disease dataset is presented containing original and augmented datasets of a variety of eye diseases such as Retinitis Pigmentosa  Retinal Detachment  Pterygium  Myopia  Macular Scar  Glaucoma  Disc Edema  Diabetic Retinopathy  Central Serous Chorioretinopathy  and Healthy eye image. The classifications of this dataset are done with the help of a domain expert from a healthcare institute. A total of 5335 images of healthy and affected eye images were collected from Anwara Hamida Eye Hospital in Faridpur and BNS Zahrul Haque Eye Hospital in Faridpur district with the help of the hospital authorities. Then from these original images  a total of 16242 augmented images are produced by using Rotation  Width shifting  Height shifting  Translation  Flipping  and Zooming techniques to increase the number of data.

Metadata Collaborators Authors Coverage DOI Citation Provenance License Expected Update Frequency Activity Overview Views Downloads Engagement Comments Top Contributors Detail View Similar Datasets,Context Diabetes is a chronic health condition that affects how your body turns food into energy. There are three main types of diabetes: type 1  type 2  and gestational diabetes. Type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune disease that causes your body to attack the cells in your pancreas that produce insulin. Insulin is a hormone that helps your body use glucose for energy. Type 2 diabetes is the most common type of diabetes. It occurs when your body doesn't respond normally to insulin  or when your body doesn't produce enough insulin. Gestational diabetes is a type of diabetes that develops during pregnancy. It usually goes away after the baby is born. Prevalence of Diabetes According to the CDC BRFSS 2023  34.1 million adults in the United States have diabetes  or 10.5% of the adult population. This number has been increasing over time. In 2010  29.1 million adults in the United States had diabetes  or 9.3% of the adult population. Content The Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) is an ongoing  state-based telephone survey that collects data about health-related risk behaviors  chronic health conditions  and the use of preventive services among adults aged 18 years and older residing in the United States. Conducted annually by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)  the BRFSS has been providing valuable insights into the health status and behaviors of U.S. adults since its inception in 1984. For this dataset  a csv of the 2023 BRFSS dataset available on Kaggle was used. The original dataset contains responses from 433 323 individuals and has 350 features. These features are either questions directly asked of participants  or calculated variables based on individual participant responses. This dataset contains 3 files: diabetes_012_health_indicators_BRFSS2023.csv is a clean dataset of 261 589 survey responses to the CDC's BRFSS2021. The target variable Diabetes_012 has 3 classes. 0 is for no diabetes or only during pregnancy  1 is for prediabetes  and 2 is for diabetes. There is class imbalance in this dataset. This dataset has 21 feature variables. diabetes_binary_5050split_health_indicators_BRFSS2023.csv is a clean dataset of 71 814 survey responses to the CDC's BRFSS2021. It has an equal 50-50 split of respondents with no diabetes and with either prediabetes or diabetes. The target variable Diabetes_binary has 2 classes. 0 is for no diabetes  and 1 is for prediabetes or diabetes. This dataset has 21 feature variables and is balanced. diabetes_binary_health_indicators_BRFSS2023.csv is a clean dataset of 261 589 survey responses to the CDC's BRFSS2021. The target variable Diabetes_binary has 2 classes. 0 is for no diabetes  and 1 is for prediabetes or diabetes. This dataset has 21 feature variables and is not balanced. Acknowledgements It it important to reiterate that I did not create this dataset  it is just a cleaned and consolidated dataset created from the BRFSS 2021 dataset already on Kaggle. That dataset can be found here and the notebook I used for the data cleaning can be found here. Inspiration Jullien Nazreenfor Cleaning the dataset for Machine Learning use by using the 2021 BRFSS was the inspiration for creating this dataset and exploring the BRFSS in general.

Metadata Collaborators Authors Coverage DOI Citation Provenance License Expected Update Frequency Activity Overview Views Downloads Engagement Comments Top Contributors Detail View Related Notebooks Similar Datasets,Dataset Description: Insurance Claims Prediction Introduction:In the insurance industry  accurately predicting the likelihood of claims is essential for risk assessment and policy pricing. However  insurance claims datasets frequently suffer from class imbalance  where the number of non-claims instances far exceeds that of actual claims. This class imbalance poses challenges for predictive modeling  often leading to biased models favoring the majority class  resulting in subpar performance for the minority class  which is typically of greater interest. Dataset Overview:The dataset utilized in this project comprises historical data on insurance claims  encompassing a variety of information about the policyholders  their demographics  past claim history  and other pertinent features. The dataset is structured to facilitate predictive modeling tasks aimed at accurately identifying the likelihood of future insurance claims. Key Features: Objective:The primary objective of utilizing this dataset is to develop robust predictive models capable of accurately assessing the likelihood of insurance claims. By leveraging advanced machine learning techniques  such as classification algorithms and ensemble methods  the aim is to mitigate the effects of class imbalance and produce models that demonstrate high predictive performance across both majority and minority classes. Application Areas: Conclusion:The insurance claims dataset serves as a valuable resource for developing predictive models aimed at enhancing risk management  policy pricing  and overall operational efficiency within the insurance industry. By addressing the challenges posed by class imbalance and leveraging the rich array of features available  organizations can gain valuable insights into insurance claim likelihood and make informed decisions to mitigate risk and optimize business outcomes.

Metadata Collaborators Authors Coverage DOI Citation Provenance License Expected Update Frequency Activity Overview Views Downloads Engagement Comments Top Contributors Detail View Related Notebooks Similar Datasets,Solar-based energy is becoming one of the most promising sources for producing power for residential  commercial  and industrial applications. Energy production based on solar photovoltaic (PV) systems has gained much attention from researchers and practitioners recently due to its desirable characteristics. However  the main difficulty in solar energy production is the volatility intermittent of photovoltaic system power generation  which is mainly due to weather conditions. For the large-scale solar farms  the power imbalance of the photovoltaic system may cause a significant loss in their economical profit. Accurate forecasting of the power output of PV systems in a short term is of great importance for daily/hourly efficient management of power grid production  delivery  and storage  as well as for decision-making on the energy market  facilitate early participation in energy auction markets and efficient resource planning.

Sales values across markets We see an increase in sales across all markets and throughout 2012-2015.We have high sales volumes in the USCA and LATAM markets:‚Ä¢    USCA: USD 757 108 in 2015;‚Ä¢    LATAM: USD 706 632 in 2015. Sales across product categories Office supplies were the largely sold product category in 2012-2015. Technology was the least sold product category by quantity. However  the Technology category yields high sales. Further analysis of profitable products reveals that phones and copiers demonstrate high sales. Sales across segmentsThe data reveals that there are high sales in the Consumer segment across all product categories. Diagnostic analytics Two sample T-testUsing a t-test  we can evaluate how sales differ across different segments  regions  and product types. T-test allows us to evaluate the statistical significance of sales samples.The two-sample t-test of sales numbers across markets resulted in the statistical significance of sales in USCA and LATAM markets with p-values >0.05. The two-sample t-test of sales numbers across product categories resulted in the statistical significance of sales in Office supplies and Technology categories with p-values >0.05. Pearson correlationThe correlation of continuous values in the dataset allows us to see the relationship between sales  quantity sold  shipping costs and profit. As we can see  there is a high correlation coefficient between sales and shipping costs  equal to 0.76. Also  there is a relationship between quantities sold and sales  equal to 0.31  and sales and profit with a correlation coefficient equal to 0.48. Predictive analyticsThe descriptive and diagnostic analysis above revealed factors that can be used for our regression analysis. Linear RegressionDependent variable: SalesIndependent variables: quantity  shipping costs  Product category (Office  Technology)  Markets (LATAM  USCA).For categorical variables such as Product category and Markets  dummy variables were created using the IF function in MS Excel. The linear regression analysis resulted in the adjusted R2=0.60  which means that 60% of the variability in sales can be explained by the variability in independent variables: quantity  shipping costs  Product category (Office  Technology)  and Markets (LATAM  USCA). The first linear regression model coefficients demonstrate that the following independent variables have high p-values and should be removed from the model: Product category (Office  Technology) and markets (LATAM  USCA). Thus  the final regression model resulted in the following summary. The coefficient column demonstrates that a one-unit change in quantities sold leads to a 24-dollar increase in sales. Also  a one-unit change in shipping costs resulted in a 6 six-dollar increase in sales. Overall  the p-value for quantity and shipping cost shows that these two independent variables have statistical significance (p-values <0.05). The regression formula for predicting sales:y=a+bx1+bx2 = y=-3.94 + 24.22*x + 6.27 *x Sales forecasting Option 1:Sales forecasting using Trendline in Excel is good option. However  R-squared value is equal to 0.15 which means that the the trendline poorly fits in the data. Option 2:Using the Forecast function in Data Analysis pane in MS Excel gives the following results.

So normally they tun A/B tests  that is a randomized experimentation process wherein two or more versions of a variable (web page  page element  banner  etc.) are shown to different segments of people at the same time to determine which version leaves the maximum impact and drive business metrics. The companies are interested in answering two questions: With the second question in mind  we normally do an A/B test. The majority of the people  will be exposed to ads (the experimental group). And a small portion of people (the control group) would instead see a Public Service Announcement (PSA) (or nothing) in the exact size and place the ad would normally be. The idea of the dataset is to analyze the groups  find if the ads were successful  how much the company can make from the ads  and if the difference between the groups is statistically significant.

Thus  we need bold and sustainable algorithms and approaches toanalyze the IOT sensor dataand find hidden patterns and insights.Heat Index(temperature + humidity) is one common data recorded on these IOT readers. The frequency of the upcoming data is very fast. The sensor readshundreds to millions of data per second. There is a huge and versatile application of this data in real world. like:- Agriculture  weather forecasting  soil monitoring and treatment  enterprise maintenance  Data centres  and many more‚Ä¶ Therefore  Wrangling  analyzing  and grasping insights from these data are equally important for multiple application sectors. This dataset is a small snap (sample) out of ocean-depth entries in the original dataset  which keeps increasing day by day. The purpose of this dataset is to allow fellow Scientists/ Analysts to play andFind the unfounds. üôè This dataset contains the temperature readings from IOT devices installed outside and inside of an anonymous Room (say -  admin room). The device was in the alpha testing phase. So  It was uninstalled or shut off several times during the entire reading period (28-07-2018 to 08-12-2018). This random interval recordings and few mis-readings ( outliers) makes it more challanging to perform analysis on this data. Let's see  what you can present in the plate out of this messy data. ##### Technical Details: columns = 5 | Rows = 97605 id: unique IDs for each reading room_id/id: room id in which device was installed (inside and/or outside) -> currently 'admin room' only for example purpose. noted_date: date and time of reading temp: temperature readings out/in: whether reading was taken from device installed inside or outside of room? I sincerely thank the team wokring at**LimelightIT Research**for providing me the device to record the data and helping me throughout the project. I have always been curious to know how climate changes day by day  year to year. One way to understnad this is by analysis and understanding the heat index of an area. Temperature data is a small part of it. But  The finidngs can lead to bigger and more serious inventions and outcomes! From this dataset   it would be intersting to find out: what was the max and min temperature? How outside temperature was related to inside temperature? any relation between the two? What was the variance of temperature for inside and outside room temperature? What is the trend in the data? Can you use Time Series Forecast algo to predict the next scenario? which was the hottest/coolest month ? any warning signals fro climate disaster ? and many more‚Ä¶ Data Science is all about finding the possibilities and verifying the probabilities!

Metadata Collaborators Authors Coverage DOI Citation Provenance License Expected Update Frequency Activity Overview Views Downloads Engagement Comments Top Contributors Detail View Related Notebooks Similar Datasets,When evaluating computer vision projects  training and test data are essential. The used data is a representation of a challenge a proposed system shall solve. It is desirable to have a large database with large variation representing the challenge  e.g detecting and recognizing traffic lights (TLs) in an urban environment. From surveying existing work it is clear that currently evaluation is limited primarily to small local datasets gathered by the authors themselves and not a public available dataset. The local datasets are often small in size and contain little variation. This makes it nearly impossible to compare the work and results from different author  but it also become hard to identify the current state of a field. In order to provide a common basis for future comparison of traffic light recognition (TLR) research  an extensive public database is collected based on footage from US roads. The database consists of continuous test and training video sequences  totaling 43 007 frames and 113 888 annotated traffic lights. The sequences are captured by a stereo camera mounted on the roof of a vehicle driving under both night- and daytime with varying light and weather conditions. Only the left camera view is used in this database  so the stereo feature is in the current state not used. The database is collected in San Diego  California  USA. The database provides four day-time and two night-time sequences primarily used for testing  providing 23 minutes and 25 seconds of driving in Pacific Beach and La Jolla  San Diego. The stereoimage pairs are acquired using the Point Grey‚Äôs Bumblebee XB3 (BBX3-13S2C-60) which contains three lenses which capture images with a resolution of 1280 x 960  each with a Field of View(FoV) of 66¬∞.  Where the left camera view is used for all the test sequences and training clips. The training clips consists of 13 daytime clips and 5 nighttime clips. The annotation.zip contains are two types of annotation present for each sequence and clip. The first annotation type contains information of the entire TL area and what state the TL is in. This annotation file is called frameAnnotationsBOX  and is generated from the second annotation file by enlarging all annotation larger than 4x4. The second one is annotation marking only the area of the traffic light which is lit and what state it is in. This second annotation file is called frameAnnotationsBULB. The annotations are stored as 1 annotation per line with the addition of information such as class tag and file path to individual image files. With this structure the annotations are stored in a csv file  where the structure is exemplified in below listing: Filename;Annotation tag;Upper left corner X;Upper left corner Y;Lower right corner X;Lower right corner Y;Origin file;Origin frame number;Origin track;Origin track frame number When using this dataset we would appreciate if you cite the following papers: Jensen MB  Philipsen MP  M√∏gelmose A  Moeslund TB  Trivedi MM.Vision for Looking at Traffic Lights: Issues  Survey  and Perspectives.

In abdominal radiology  US images are most used in the continuous observation of patients with liver cirrhosis or chronic hepatitis to detect hepatocellular carcinoma and evaluate the degree of liver fibrosis. US images are taken using the reflected wave of a sound wave pulse. Unlike superficial organs  such as the breasts and thyroid gland  the liver is located deep inside the human body. Therefore  during the process of transmitting and receiving signals inside the human body  which has numerous obstacles  the signals are weakened and the probability of exposure to various noises increases. Dataset Description:This dataset is derived from the research conducted byY. Joo  H. -C. Park  O. -J. Lee  C. Yoon  M. H. Choi  and C. Choi  titled ""Classification of Liver Fibrosis From Heterogeneous Ultrasound Image "" published in IEEE Access  vol. 11  pp. 9920-9930  2023. The dataset includes ultrasound (US) images obtained from a tertiary university hospital (Seoul St. Mary‚Äôs Hospital) used for training and validation purposes. Data from another university hospital (Eunpyeong St. Mary‚Äôs Hospital) were utilized for testing. In general  F0 and F4 are easily obtained  and they account for more than half of the dataset. Class F4  which represents significantly advanced liver cirrhosis  accounted for 27% of the dataset. However  the distributions of F1  F2  and F3 were relatively low because only a small number of patients were tested in the early stages of cirrhosis. The proportions of F1  F2  and F3 in our dataset are each 13%. What is Liver Fibrosis?A condition where liver tissue becomes scarred due to prolonged inflammation or damage  affecting liver function and potentially leading to severe complications if untreated. Image Format:JPG filesCategories:5 stages of liver fibrosis Class Breakdown: F0 - No Fibrosis: 2114 imagesDescription: Represents healthy liver tissue with no signs of fibrosis. The tissue appears normal  with no scarring or fibrosis present. F1 - Portal Fibrosis: 861 imagesDescription: Indicates fibrosis occurring around portal areas of the liver. Portal fibrosis involves the formation of scar tissue around the portal veins  which are small blood vessels in the liver. F2 - Periportal Fibrosis: 793 imagesDescription: Shows fibrosis around the edges of the liver's portal areas. Periportal fibrosis is characterized by scarring around the liver's boundary regions  often affecting the areas near the portal veins. F3 - Septal Fibrosis: 857 imagesDescription: Features fibrosis that forms bands or septa throughout the liver tissue. Septal fibrosis involves the development of thickened scar tissue that creates bands or partitions within the liver. F4 - Cirrhosis: 1698 imagesDescription: Represents advanced fibrosis leading to cirrhosis. Cirrhosis is the most severe stage  marked by extensive scarring and loss of liver function  which can significantly impact liver health."

(a). Compared with the existing manipulation detection benchmarks   MDSM has the following advantages: {1)Risk Consideration of MLLM.}} MDSM acknowledges the emerging challenges posed by MLLMs and utilizes multi-modal to create semantically coherent and contextually plausible narratives for manipulated images. This scenario  though under-explored  is highly significant for the detection and grounding of manipulated multi-modal media. {2)Semantic Alignment.} MDSM is an aligned image-text multi-modal media manipulation benchmark  which is a significant and more practical scenario for multi-modal manipulation detection. {3)Large Scale.} Our MDSM comprises 441 423 samples and is the largest benchmark for detecting and grounding multi-modal manipulation. \textbf{4)Diverse Multi-media Sources.} The multi-modal media of MDSM sources from diverse media sites  including \textit{The Guardian}  \textit{The New York Times}  \textit{The Washington Post}  \textit{USA Today}  and \textit{the BBC}. Consequently  the generality of methods can be assessed via cross-domain evaluation.

The survey is unique in that it combines interviews and physical examinations. NHANES is a major program of the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS). NCHS is part of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and has the responsibility for producing vital and health statistics for the Nation. The NHANES program began in the early 1960s and has been conducted as a series of surveys focusing on different population groups or health topics. In 1999  the survey became a continuous program that has a changing focus on a variety of health and nutrition measurements to meet emerging needs. The survey examines a nationally representative sample of about 5 000 persons each year. These persons are located in counties across the country  15 of which are visited each year. The NHANES interview includes demographic  socioeconomic  dietary  and health-related questions. The examination component consists of medical  dental  and physiological measurements  as well as laboratory tests administered by highly trained medical personnel. To date thousands of research findings have been published using the NHANES data.

How would you describe this dataset? Metadata Collaborators Authors Coverage DOI Citation Provenance License Expected Update Frequency Activity Overview Views Downloads Engagement Comments Top Contributors Detail View Related Notebooks Similar Datasets,"Microsoftis challenging the data science community to develop techniques for predicting the next significant cybersecurity incident. GUIDE  the largest publicly available collection of real-world cybersecurity incidents  enables researchers and practitioners to experiment with authentic cybersecurity data to advance the state of cybersecurity. This groundbreaking dataset contains over13 million pieces of evidence across33 entity types  covering 1.6 million alerts and1 million annotated incidentswith triage labels from customers over a two-week period. Of these incidents  26 000 contain additional remediation action labels from customers. The dataset includes telemetry from over 6 100 organizations  featuring 9 100 unique custom and built-in DetectorIds across numerous security products  encompassing 441 MITRE ATT&CK techniques. GUIDE offers a first of its kind opportunity to develop and benchmark next-generation machine learning models on comprehensive guided response telemetry  supporting efforts to tackle one of cybersecurity's most challenging problems. For additional information on GUIDE and Microsoft's approach to Guided Response in Copilot for Security  see the arXiv paperhere. In the rapidly evolving cybersecurity landscape  the sharp rise in threat actors has overwhelmed enterprise security operation centers (SOCs) with an unprecedented volume of incidents to triage. This surge requires solutions that can either partially or fully automate the remediation process. Fully automated systems demand an exceptionally high confidence threshold to ensure correct actions are taken 99% of the time to avoid inadvertently disabling critical enterprise assets. Consequently  attaining such a high level of confidence often renders full automation impractical. This challenge has catalyzed the development of guided response (GR) systems to support SOC analysts by facilitating informed decision-making. Extended Detection and Response (XDR) products are ideally positioned to deliver precise  context-rich guided response recommendations thanks to their comprehensive visibility across the entire enterprise security landscape. By consolidating telemetry across endpoints  network devices  cloud environments  email systems  and more  XDR systems can harness a wide array of data to provide historical context  generate detailed insights into the nature of threats  and recommend tailored remediation actions. We provide three hierarchies of data: (1) evidence  (2) alert  and (3) incident. At the bottom level  evidence supports an alert. For example  an alert may be associated with multiple pieces of evidence such as an IP address  email  and user details  each containing specific supporting metadata. Above that  we have alerts that consolidate multiple pieces of evidence to signify a potential security incident. These alerts provide a broader context by aggregating related evidences to present a more comprehensive picture of the potential threat. At the highest level  incidents encompass one or more alerts  representing a cohesive narrative of a security breach or threat scenario. With the release of GUIDE  we aim to establish a standardized benchmark for guided response systems using real-world data. The primary objective of the dataset is to accurately predict incident triage grades‚Äîtrue positive (TP)  benign positive (BP)  and false positive (FP)‚Äîbased on historical customer responses. To support this  we provide a training dataset containing 45 features  labels  and unique identifiers across 1M triage-annotated incidents. We divide the dataset into a train set containing 70% of the data and a test set with 30%  stratified based on triage grade ground-truth  OrgId  and DetectorId. We ensure that incidents are stratified together within the train and test sets to ensure the relevance of evidence and alert rows. A secondary objective of GUIDE is to benchmark the remediation capabilities of guided response systems. To this end  we release 26k ground-truth labels for predicting remediation actions for alerts  available at both granular and aggregate levels. The recommended metric for evaluating research using the GUIDE dataset is macro-F1 score  along with details on precision and recall. To ensure privacy  we implement a stringent anonymization process. Initially  sensitive values are pseudo-anonymized using SHA1 hashing techniques. This step ensures that unique identifiers are obfuscated while maintaining their uniqueness for consistency across the dataset. Following this  we replace these hashed values with randomly generated IDs to further enhance anonymity and prevent any potential re-identification. Additionally  we introduce noise to the timestamps  ensuring that the temporal aspects of the data cannot be traced back to specific events. This multi-layered approach  combining pseudo-anonymization and randomization  safeguards the privacy of all entities involved while maintaining the integrity and utility of the dataset for research and development purposes.

Metadata Collaborators Authors Coverage DOI Citation Provenance License Expected Update Frequency Activity Overview Views Downloads Engagement Comments Top Contributors Detail View Related Notebooks Similar Datasets,"Stocks and financial instrument trading is a lucrative proposition. Stock markets across the world facilitate such trades and thus wealth exchanges hands. Stock prices move up and down all the time and having ability to predict its movement has immense potential to make one rich.Stock price prediction has kept people interested from a long time. There are hypothesis like the Efficient Market Hypothesis  which says that it is almost impossible to beat the market consistently and there are others which disagree with it. There are a number of known approaches and new research going on to find the magic formula to make you rich. One of the traditional methods is the time series forecasting. Fundamental analysis is another method where numerous performance ratios are analyzed to assess a given stock. On the emerging front  there are neural networks  genetic algorithms  and ensembling techniques. Another challenging problem in stock price prediction isBlack Swan Event   unpredictable events that cause stock market turbulence. These are events that occur from time to time  are unpredictable and often come with little or no warning. A black swan event is an event that is completely unexpected and cannot be predicted. Unexpected events are generally referred to as black swans when they have significant consequences  though an event with few consequences might also be a black swan event. It may or may not be possible to provide explanations for the occurrence after the fact ‚Äì but not before. In complex systems  like economies  markets and weather systems  there are often several causes. After such an event  many of the explanations for its occurrence will be overly simplistic. New bleeding age state-of-the-art  deep learning models stock predictions is overcoming such  obstacles e.g. ""Transformer and Time Embeddings"". An objectives are to apply these novel models to forecast stock price. Stock price prediction is the task of forecasting the future value of a given stock. Given the historical daily close price for S&P 500 Index  prepare and compare forecasting solutions. S&P 500 or Standard and Poor's 500 index is an index comprising of 500 stocks from different sectors of US economy and is an indicator of US equities. Other such indices are the Dow 30  NIFTY 50  Nikkei 225  etc.For the purpose of understanding  we are utilizing S&P500 index  concepts  and knowledge can be applied to other stocks as well. The historical stock price information is also publicly available. For our current use case  we will utilize the pandas_datareader library to get the required S&P 500 index history usingYahoo Finance databases.  We utilize the closing price information from the dataset available though other information such as opening price  adjusted closing price  etc.  are also available.We prepare a utility function get_raw_data() to extract required information in a pandas dataframe. The function takes index ticker name as input. For S&P 500 index  the ticker name is ^GSPC. The following snippet uses the utility function to get the required data.(SeeSimple LSTM Regression) Features and Terminology:In stock trading  the high and low refer to the maximum and minimum prices in a given time period. Open and close are the prices at which a stock began and ended trading in the same period. Volume is the total amount of trading activity. Adjusted values factor in corporate actions such as dividends  stock splits  and new share issuance. Mining and updating of this dateset will depend uponYahoo Finance. Sort of variation of sequence modeling and bleeding age e.g. attention can be applied for research and forecasting"

Metadata Collaborators Authors Coverage DOI Citation Provenance License Expected Update Frequency Activity Overview Views Downloads Engagement Comments Top Contributors Detail View Related Notebooks Similar Datasets,Quora's first public dataset is related to the problem of identifying duplicate questions. At Quora  an important product principle is that there should be a single question page for each logically distinct question. For example  the queries ‚ÄúWhat is the most populous state in the USA?‚Äù and ‚ÄúWhich state in the United States has the most people?‚Äù should not exist separately on Quora because the intent behind both is identical. Having a canonical page for each logically distinct query makes knowledge-sharing more efficient in many ways: for example  knowledge seekers can access all the answers to a question in a single location  and writers can reach a larger readership than if that audience was divided amongst several pages. The dataset is based on actual data from Quora and will give anyone the opportunity to train and test models of semantic equivalence. There are over 400 000 lines of potential question duplicate pairs. Each line contains IDs for each question in the pair  the full text for each question  and a binary value that indicates whether the line truly contains a duplicate pair. For more information on this dataset  check out Quora'sfirst dataset release page. This data is subject to Quora'sTerms of Service  allowing for non-commercial use.

After training  the model can detect similar words and recommend words to complete a partial sentence. As its name suggests  word2vec maps each distinct word to a vector  which is assigned in such a way that the level of semantic similarity between words is indicated by a simple mathematical operation on the vectors that the words are mapped to (for instance  thecosine similaritybetween the vectors). The dataset includes pre-trained vectors trained on a portion of the Google News dataset (consisting of about 100 billion words). The model contains 300-dimensional vectors for about 3 million words and phrases. The phrases were obtained using a simple  data-driven approach discussed inthis paper.

Cortez and A. Morais. A Data Mining Approach to Predict Forest Fires using Meteorological Data.In Proceedings of the 13th EPIA 2007 - Portuguese Conference on Artificial Intelligence December  2007. (http://www.dsi.uminho.pt/~pcortez/fires.pdf) In the above reference  the output ""area"" was first transformed with a ln(x+1) function.Then  several Data Mining methods were applied. After fitting the models  the outputs werepost-processed with the inverse of the ln(x+1) transform. Four different input setups wereused. The experiments were conducted using a 10-fold (cross-validation) x 30 runs. Tworegression metrics were measured: MAD and RMSE. A Gaussian support vector machine (SVM) fedwith only 4 direct weather conditions (temp  RH  wind and rain) obtained the best MAD value:12.71 +- 0.01 (mean and confidence interval within 95% using a t-student distribution). Thebest RMSE was attained by the naive mean predictor. An analysis to the regression error curve(REC) shows that the SVM model predicts more examples within a lower admitted error. In effect the SVM model predicts better small fires  which are the majority. Relevant Information: This is a very difficult regression task. It can be used to test regression methods. Also it could be used to test outlier detection methods  since it is not clear how many outliersare there. Yet  the number of examples of fires with a large burned area is very small. Number of Instances: 517 Number of Attributes: 12 + output attribute Note: several of the attributes may be correlated  thus it makes sense to apply some sort offeature selection.

I've tried handling missing values  treating this just like a regression problem. I got some very interesting results. And I have even seen a similar designation in one of the top-rated notebooks  but there had been no performance evaluation for this designation and I considered it a shortcoming. Then considering R_square  I thought that the pipeline-based data assignment actually had a very low result and shouldn't even be considered a regression because the result was less than 0.3: Instead  I found the most suitable algorithms (GradientBoostingRegressor  CatBoost  Light_GBM  and XGBoost) for a similar assignment with PyCaret  optimized it with optuna  and then developed a model using the blend method. I know still low  but this model showed the highest performance among all models. Then I wanted to make it available to all Kagglers. In terms of model estimation  you can try my previous notebook:My notebook **## Context: ** A stroke is a medical condition in which poor blood flow to the brain causes cell death. There are two main types of stroke: ischemic  due to lack of blood flow  and hemorrhagic  due to bleeding. Both cause parts of the brain to stop functioning properly. Signs and symptoms of a stroke may include an inability to move or feel on one side of the body  problems understanding or speaking  dizziness  or loss of vision to one side. Signs and symptoms often appear soon after the stroke has occurred. If symptoms last less than one or two hours  the stroke is a transient ischemic attack (TIA)  also called a mini-stroke. A hemorrhagic stroke may also be associated with a severe headache. The symptoms of a stroke can be permanent. Long-term complications may include pneumonia and loss of bladder control. The main risk factor for stroke is high blood pressure. Other risk factors include high blood cholesterol  tobacco smoking  obesity  diabetes mellitus  a previous TIA  end-stage kidney disease  and atrial fibrillation. An ischemic stroke is typically caused by blockage of a blood vessel  though there are also less common causes. A hemorrhagic stroke is caused by either bleeding directly into the brain or into the space between the brain's membranes. Bleeding may occur due to a ruptured brain aneurysm. Diagnosis is typically based on a physical exam and supported by medical imaging such as a CT scan or MRI scan. A CT scan can rule out bleeding  but may not necessarily rule out ischemia  which early on typically does not show up on a CT scan. Other tests such as an electrocardiogram (ECG) and blood tests are done to determine risk factors and rule out other possible causes. Low blood sugar may cause similar symptoms. Prevention includes decreasing risk factors  surgery to open up the arteries to the brain in those with problematic carotid narrowing  and warfarin in people with atrial fibrillation. Aspirin or statins may be recommended by physicians for prevention. A stroke or TIA often requires emergency care. An ischemic stroke  if detected within three to four and half hours  may be treatable with a medication that can break down the clot. Some hemorrhagic strokes benefit from surgery. Treatment to attempt recovery of lost function is called stroke rehabilitation  and ideally takes place in a stroke unit; however  these are not available in much of the world. ##Attribute Information 1) gender: ""Male""  ""Female"" or ""Other""2) age: age of the patient3) hypertension: 0 if the patient doesn't have hypertension  1 if the patient has hypertension4) heart_disease: 0 if the patient doesn't have any heart diseases  1 if the patient has a heart disease5) ever_married: ""No"" or ""Yes""6) work_type: ""children""  ""Govt_jov""  ""Never_worked""  ""Private"" or ""Self-employed""7) Residence_type: ""Rural"" or ""Urban""8) avg_glucose_level: average glucose level in blood9) bmi: body mass index10) smoking_status: ""formerly smoked""  ""never smoked""  ""smokes"" or ""Unknown""*11) stroke: 1 if the patient had a stroke or 0 if not *Note: ""Unknown"" in smoking_status means that the information is unavailable for this patient DataIEEE article"

To remedy that  I have uploaded this data set so people may practice. Banks play a crucial role in market economies. They decide who can get finance and on what terms and can make or break investment decisions. For markets and society to function  individuals and companies need access to credit. Credit scoring algorithms  which make a guess at the probability of default  are the method banks use to determine whether or not a loan should be granted. This competition requires participants to improve on the state of the art in credit scoring  by predicting the probability that somebody will experience financial distress in the next two years.

However  clinical diagnosis of a chest X-ray can be challenging and sometimes more difficult than diagnosis via chest CT imaging. The lack of large publicly available datasets with annotations means it is still very difficult  if not impossible  to achieve clinically relevant computer-aided detection and diagnosis (CAD) in real world medical sites with chest X-rays. One major hurdle in creating large X-ray image datasets is the lack resources for labeling so many images. Prior to the release of this dataset Openiwas the largest publicly available source of chest X-ray images with 4 143 images available. This NIH Chest X-ray Dataset is comprised of 112 120 X-ray images with disease labels from 30 805 unique patients. To create these labels  the authors used Natural Language Processing to text-mine disease classifications from the associated radiological reports. The labels are expected to be >90% accurate and suitable for weakly-supervised learning. The original radiology reports are not publicly available but you can find more details on the labeling process in this Open Access paper: ""ChestX-ray8: Hospital-scale Chest X-ray Database and Benchmarks on Weakly-Supervised Classification and Localization of Common Thorax Diseases.""

The following image processing and enhancement techniques are used to colorize and improve visual interpretation for diagnostics  training  or AI preprocessing.üî∑ 1. 3D_RenderingRenders medical image volumes into three-dimensional visualizations. Though often grayscale  color can be applied to different tissue types or densities to enhance spatial understanding. Useful in surgical planning or tumor visualization. üî∑ 2. 3D_Volume_RenderingAn advanced visualization technique that projects 3D image volumes with transparency and color blending  simulating how light passes through tissue. Color helps distinguish internal structures like organs  vessels  or tumors. üî∑ 3. Adaptive Histogram Equalization (AHE)Enhances contrast locally within the image  especially in low-contrast regions. When colorized  different intensities are mapped to distinct hues  improving visibility of fine-grained details like soft tissues or lesions. üî∑ 4. Alpha BlendingA layering technique that combines multiple images (e.g.  CT + annotation masks) with transparency. Colors represent different modalities or regions of interest  providing composite visual cues for diagnosis. üî∑ 5. Basic Color MapApplies a standard color palette (like Jet or Viridis) to grayscale data. Different intensities are mapped to different colors  enhancing the visual discrimination of anatomical or pathological regions in the image. üî∑ 6. Contrast StretchingExpands the grayscale range to improve brightness and contrast. When combined with color mapping  tissues with similar intensities become visually distinct  aiding in tasks like bone vs. soft tissue separation. üî∑ 7. Edge DetectionExtracts and overlays object boundaries (e.g.  organ or lesion outlines) on the original scan. Edge maps are typically colorized (e.g.  green or red) to highlight anatomical structures or abnormalities clearly. üî∑ 8. Gamma CorrectionAdjusts image brightness non-linearly. Color can be used to highlight underexposed or overexposed regions  often revealing soft tissue structures otherwise hidden in raw grayscale CT/X-ray images. üî∑ 9. Gaussian BlurSmooths image noise and details. When visualized with color overlays (e.g.  before vs. after)  it helps assess denoising effectiveness. It is also used in segmentation preprocessing to reduce edge artifacts. üî∑ 10. Heatmap VisualizationEncodes intensity or prediction confidence into a heatmap overlay (e.g.  red for high activity). Common in AI-assisted diagnosis to localize tumors  fractures  or infections  layered over the original grayscale image. üî∑ 11. Interactive SegmentationA semi-automated method to extract regions of interest with user input. Segmented areas are color-coded (e.g.  tumor = red  background = blue) for immediate visual confirmation and further analysis. üî∑ 12. LUT (Lookup Table) Color MapMaps grayscale values to custom color palettes using a lookup table. This enhances contrast and emphasizes certain intensity ranges (e.g.  blood vessels vs. bone)  improving interpretability for radiologists. üî∑ 13. Random Color PaletteApplies random but consistent colors to segmented regions or labels. Common in datasets with multiple classes (e.g.  liver  spleen  kidneys)  it helps in visual verification of label diversity. üß¨ ConclusionThese colorization methods do not change the underlying medical data  but they significantly enhance its interpretability for radiologists  researchers  and machine learning algorithms. Color adds clarity  contrast  and context to features that may be missed in grayscale  making it a powerful tool in modern medical imaging workflows. Steps to Create Train/Test/Validation Splits after Image Processing These techniques can be used individually or in combination. For instance  you could apply Edge Detection and Gamma Correction to the same images to highlight structural boundaries and improve contrast. Organize Data Based on TechniquesAfter applying the image processing techniques  images should be stored in separate folders for each technique. Determine Splitting CriteriaTypically  medical datasets are split into three parts: Train Set: 70% of the data  used to train the model. Test Set: 15% of the data  used to evaluate the model‚Äôs performance on unseen data. Validation Set: 15% of the data  used during model training to tune hyperparameters. If there are fewer than 1000 images  adjust the split sizes accordingly. For example: Training Set: Take as many images as possible up to the limit (e.g.  1000). Test and Validation Sets: Fill the remaining slots with the next 200 images for each. The randomization can be done using tools like Python's random.shuffle().

Its intresting to see application of AI to assist clinicians during patient treatment in a privacy preserving way. While scientific knowledge can help guide interventions  there remains a key need to quickly cut through the space of decision policies to find effective strategies to support patients during the care process. Offline Reinforcement learning (also referred to as safe or batch reinforcement learning) is a promising sub-field of RL which provides us with a mechanism for solving real world sequential decision making problems where access to simulator is not available. Here we assume that learn a policy from fixed dataset of trajectories with further interaction with the environment(agent doesn't receive reward or punishment signal from the environment). It has shown that such an approach can leverage vast amount of existing logged data (in the form of previous interactions with the environment) and can outperform supervised learning approaches or heuristic based policies for solving real world - decision making problems. Offline RL algorithms when trained on  sufficiently large and diverse offline datasets can produce close to optimal policies(ability to generalize beyond training data). As Part of my PhD  research  I investigated the problem of developing a Clinical Decision Support System for Sepsis Management using Offline Deep Reinforcement Learning. MIMIC-III ('Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care')  is a large open-access anonymized single-center database which consists of comprehensive clinical data of  61 532  critical care admissions from 2001‚Äì2012 collected at a Boston teaching hospital. Dataset consists of 47 features (including demographics  vitals  and lab test results) on a cohort of sepsis patients who meet the sepsis-3 definition criteria. we try to answer the following question: Given a particular patient‚Äôs characteristics and physiological information at each time step as input  can our DeepRL approach  learn an optimal treatment policy that can prescribe the right intervention(e.g use of ventilator) to the patient each stage of the treatment process  in order to improve the final outcome(e.g patient mortality)? we can use popular state-of-the-art algorithms such as Deep Q Learning(DQN)  Double Deep Q Learning (DDQN)  DDQN combined with BNC  Mixed Monte Carlo(MMC) and Persistent Advantage Learning (PAL). Using these methods we can train an RL policy to recommend optimum treatment path for a given patient.
